        "intro = \"In recent years, crowdfunding has emerged as a popular financing mechanism that allows various types of projects to get funded. Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, i.e., crowdfunding websites. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5%. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (i.e., it raised at least 100% of the funding goal). With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example, examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In, the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in studied the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method.\"\n",
        "results = \"In recent years, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been offering entrepreneurs the possibility to present their projects and attract funders, and thus raise the funds necessary for their projects. The question of how different properties of the project’s presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accuracy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive F-score of 96.2%, focusing on both project-specific aspects and semantics of project descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that the buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. We have additionally shown that the features correlated to FS are dependent on project category. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances can be proposed. These recommendations are based on the features we listed above, and on influential features from previous studies. We have shown that the category of the project influences the features that have a high correlation with funding success. We offer (example) recommendations for technological projects, as follows:Entrepreneurs should update their project information during the funding period. The project’s post should contain more feelings words. The project’s description should contain buzzwords.  While this paper arrived at very high prediction accuracies of funding success, future research could further improve accuracy by considering the characteristics of images, video content and the semantics of video scripts. Further improvements in the model’s performance could be achieved via novel feature selection algorithms.\"\n",

However, there is no teacher in the motor cortex that instructs the motor neurons and learning in the brain depends on reward and punishment. We demonstrate a biologically plausible reinforcement learning scheme for deep networks with an arbitrary number of layers. The network chooses an action by selecting a unit in the output layer and uses feedback connections to assign credit to the units in successively lower layers that are responsible for this action. After the choice, the network receives reinforcement and there is no teacher correcting the errors. We show how the new learning scheme – Attention-Gated Brain Propagation (BrainProp) – is mathematically equivalent to error backpropagation, for one output unit at a time. We demonstrate successful learning of deep fully connected, convolutional and locally connected networks on classical and hard image-classification benchmarks; MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Tiny ImageNet. BrainProp achieves an accuracy that is equivalent to that of standard error-backpropagation, and better than state-of-the-art biologically inspired learning schemes. The trial-and-error nature of learning is associated with limited additional training time so that BrainProp is a factor of 1-3.5 times slower. Our results thereby provide new insights into how deep learning may be implemented in the brain.\"\n",

Feedback connections then propagate the perturbed signals back to lower layers, which can then compare activity before and after teacher intervention to estimate the error gradient for all connections. The present work addresses a number of limitations of these previous schemes. First, it avoids a teacher and replaces it by trial-and-error learning in a reinforcement learning context. Second, the scheme takes the neuromodulatory systems in the brain, such as dopamine, into account that provide a reward prediction error signal (RPE). The RPE is positive if an action selected by the network is associated with more reward than expected or if the prospects of receiving reward increase, and the RPE is negative if the outcome of the action is disappointing. These neuromodulatory signals are accessible for all neurons in the brain. Third, it uses feedback connections to propagate attentional “credit assignment” signals from higher to lower network levels which are known to gate plasticity. When a network chooses an action, the feedback signal is strongest for neurons and synapses that are responsible for the selected action. We show how this combination of the attentional feedback signals and the neuromodulatory influence can be combined at the level of a synapse to provide a learning scheme that is equivalent to EBP, for one output unit at a time. The result is a biologically plausible synaptic update rule. The learning scheme requires weight symmetry, which can occur as the result of the BrainProp learning scheme itself. Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated that the learning scheme can also function in spite of delays between the signals propagated by feedforward and feedback connections.\"\n",

But as the conflict drags into winter, Americans are divided over whether Washington should push Ukraine to reach a negotiated peace as soon as possible. More than two-thirds of respondents back supplying Ukraine with weapons and economic assistance, and about three-quarters support accepting Ukrainian refugees and sanctioning Russia, according to the survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs last month. While support among the American public for assistance to Ukraine remains robust, Republican backing for aid to Ukraine has slipped since the spring, with 55 percent of Republicans saying they support sending military aid, compared with 68 percent in July and 80 percent in March. Half of Republicans favored providing economic assistance to Ukraine last month, compared with roughly three-quarters in March, according to the Chicago Council’s findings. The United States announced its latest tranche of military aid to Ukraine last month — the 25th since August 2021. The $400 million package includes additional arms, munitions and equipment, the Defense Department said, and brings total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to nearly $20 billion since President Biden took office. The United States is also sending $53 million to help repair Ukraine’s electrical systems, which have sustained significant damage from Russian missile strikes in recent weeks. With Russia’s war in Ukraine in its 10th month, and no end in sight, Americans are split over whether Washington should urge Ukraine to reach a peace settlement with Russia imminently, the survey found. A plurality — 40 percent — said the United States should continue its current levels of support to Ukraine indefinitely. Fifty-three percent of Democrats favor this approach.

Now, 47 percent say Washington should push Kyiv to reach a peace settlement soon.\"\n",

        "mindfulness_paper = \"Aging can be experienced as a complex and challenging process, considering the increased exposure and proximity to death alongside the physical, emotional, and cognitive decline characterizing old age. Thus, interventions are critically needed to improve the elderly population's quality of life and ease its pain. Such interventions must be made accessible, as individuals in this age group often rebuff recommendations to utilize them. The current study will examine the influence of a mindfulness-based intervention for seniors (MBIS) and a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention on various psychological measures and seniors' attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment. Mindfulness has been defined in several ways, all sourced in the Buddhist tradition. The most accepted Western definition defines mindfulness as the maintenance of prolonged attention on human experiences (such as thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations) in the present, \\\"from moment to moment,\\\" and in an accepting, non-judgmental manner. This definition incorporates three components that are also referenced in the bulk of Buddhist literature on the topic of mindfulness: (1) attentive awareness; (2) current experience, and (3) acceptance. The past 30 years have been marked by extensive literature pointing to the significant advantages of meditation on various factors related to mental and physical health. The first successful studies on mindfulness examined patients suffering from chronic pain and tension. These first studies encouraged the development of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for this population. At a later stage, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) was developed. MBCT is a therapeutic intervention based on MBSR. However, it differs from it in its focus on depression and in its use of a dominant psycho-educational feature that focuses on the prevention of relapse. These two standard interventions comprise eight weekly sessions averaging 2.5 hours. A meta-analysis of 64 studies found that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in coping with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, coronary artery diseases, cancer, anxiety disorders, depression, and contextual stressors. Several theoretical underpinnings have been suggested to explain the mechanism behind the psychological-therapeutic effect accompanying the methodological practice of mindfulness. These theoretical explanations have gained broad empirical support from meta-analyses on meditation research. One theoretical explanation suggests that focusing attention and responding with acceptance and non-judgment regarding life experiences improves attentional and self-regulatory capacities. Another explanation is that the suggestion to accept any thoughts and emotions without avoidance encourages a diminished use of repression and assists in arousing autobiographical memories from specific places and times, both of which are of considerable value to mental health treatment. A third theoretical explanation suggests that mindfulness helps diminish negative ruminative thinking by bringing negative thoughts to consciousness and decreasing reactivity to them. Mindfulness also appears to influence emotional and cognitive flexibility and self-perception changes. The current study aimed to expand our understanding and knowledge of mental health in old age and to highlight its importance. The senior population is continuously challenged with maintaining and advancing its well-being. Data from a U.S. Census study that included 12,312 adults 64 years of age or older suggested that 11.4% of older adults cope with anxiety disorders and 6.8% cope with emotional disorders, all of which met the clinical criteria for diagnosis. It is important to note that by including symptoms outside the clinical criteria for diagnosis, the percentage of depression and anxiety increases significantly in the elderly, more than in any other age group. Anxiety and the decline of one's physical state are cyclically associated. Anxiety encourages avoidance behavior, which promotes muscle weakening and pathology of the muscular and skeletal systems, which then foments further atrophy. A meta-analysis on loneliness in old age identified general themes explaining and detailing the experience of loneliness in old age: the loss of significant interpersonal relationships, the negative influence of loneliness on self-perceptions, and negative emotions associated with loneliness, such as anxiety, sadness, and anger. These themes were found to be reciprocally associated with one another. The biopsychosocial model describes the mutual influence of the individual's physical, mental, and social state, positing a more significant interrelation in the elderly than in younger individuals. This model suggests that a chronically stressful environment significantly increases vulnerability to illness and the loss of functional capacities, which, in turn, increase anxiety and a sense of helplessness. Another example relates to chronic illnesses in old age, such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder, which are all associated with a higher risk for suicidal behavior in old age. Aligning with Garroway and Rybarczyk's model, depression and anxiety were found to encourage cognitive biases that act as psychological barriers which potentially delay or prevent adaptive behavior in response to challenges in old age. For example, elderly persons may eschew the use of a walking stick, as it symbolizes a deteriorating physical state and some level of submission––experienced as symbolic threats to one's identity and ego. The increased vulnerability to emotional distress in old age highlights the critical need for effective short-term interventions that can quickly improve seniors' health and quality of life.\"# A study on elderly participants that examined the efficacy of a brief, 4-week behavioral intervention found significant improvement in various psychological and cognitive measures15. Another study examined a brief 4-week behavioral intervention intended to assist seniors with chronic sleep difficulties and found significant improvement in the sleep quality of the participants in the intervention group. Only a few research studies have examined the influence of mindfulness on measures of anxiety and depression in the elderly. For example, a meta-analysis examining existing mindfulness-based interventions and their influence on mental and physical well-being in the elderly included only four studies. Two of these studies examined the influence of a standard, 8-week MBCT intervention, finding decreases in anxiety and depression measures with a moderate-to-high effect size. The other two studies examined a standard 8-week MBSR intervention, finding a decrease in measures of anxiety and depression with a high effect size. None of these four studies compared the experimental group with a control group that underwent a different treatment intervention. Three of the studies offered no comparison between the experimental group and a control group. An MBCT study on elderly individuals, incorporating an activity-based control treatment group and whose experimental group was exposed to a shortened intervention (1.5 h), also found a decrease in measures of anxiety and had a high effect size. Although these interventions demonstrated their efficacy, the various interventions were characterized by high attrition rates (about 15%). The primary sources of these attrition rates were gender (men discontinued their participation more than women), a few years of education, expectations for a quick change, and high levels of distress. A meta-analysis by Carmody and Baer suggested a solution for these high attrition rates, which examined 25 studies that implemented mindfulness-based interventions of various lengths and age groups. They believed that the high number of sessions made perseverance during the sessions problematic. They did not offer any evidence to suggest that abridged versions of mindfulness interventions are less effective than the standard intervention in diminishing emotional distress; however, they suggested shortening mindfulness interventions to make them more accessible for population groups (i.e., the elderly) that have difficulties committing to standard interventions. Another popular intervention for depression and anxiety in the elderly is CBT. As its name suggests, CBT aims to modify the thoughts and behaviors that cause distress to the patient while cultivating thoughts and behaviors that are more effective for the patient. CBT's' basic assumption is that emotional distress results from how individuals perceive and interpret their reality and is not necessarily the consequence of objective reality. CBT, therefore, places significant emphasis on solving current issues. A review of multiple meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT for anxiety and depression in the elderly found significant efficacy, as displayed by the higher than average effect sizes for CBT. It is important to note that alongside the many benefits of these interventions and the many and varied solutions mental health treatment offers the elderly, this population is less likely to seek mental health services than younger age groups1. Three factors were found to have the most significant impact on elderly persons' attitudes toward seeking treatment: (1) their perception of their aging process, (2) their perception of psychologists, and (3) their perception of social support. Furthermore, stigma––a distinguishing characteristic or trait that disqualifies those that carry it from full social acceptance––is one of the central factors for why the elderly avoid seeking mental health treatment. Considering elderly persons' distancing themselves from mental health services, the need for short-term interventions to help modify the cognitive perceptions associated with attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment becomes apparent. The appropriate intervention should contribute to increasing the utilization of therapy by the elderly, whether individual or group therapy. As noted, mindfulness-based interventions assist individuals in accepting their current thoughts and emotions non-judgmentally. In this way, the mindfulness-practicing individual observes or contemplates his thoughts instead of giving vent to an emotional reaction to them. Introspection helps create mental and emotional distance between the individual and their thoughts, facilitating, among other things, a more flexible approach to the individual's thoughts, including non-adaptive perceptions. The current study aimed to contribute to the existing literature in two ways: (1) Establishing support for a short-term mindfulness-based intervention for seniors to be effective in reducing age-related anxiety and depression and encouraging seniors' utilization of mental health treatment; (2) Comparing a mindfulness-based intervention with an alternative treatment intervention (CBT). Mindfulness-based interventions that have been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and stress in the elderly often include breathing exercises. Further, behavioral relaxation techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing are most effective in reducing anxiety and stress in the elderly. To our knowledge, research has yet to examine the influence of mindfulness on anxiety in the elderly relative to a control group that isolates the effects of diaphragmatic breathing (a potential confounding variable). For this reason, it is critical to isolate and examine the unique attentional component of mindfulness-based interventions. Similarly, to our knowledge, research has yet to examine the influence of mindfulness on attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment among the elderly. Thus, another practical goal of this study was to examine an easily deliverable and accessible group intervention in a nursing home. In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, it has become clear that efforts should be made to bring therapy to where the people are and not rely on inviting them to professional center .\"\n",

Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning. Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition. system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor.  Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Deep learning will have many more successes in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage of increases in the amount of available computation and data.  New learning algorithms and architectures that are currently being developed for deep neural networks will only accelerate this progress.\n",

            " Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. In a typical deep-learning system, there may be hundreds of millions of these adjustable weights. To properly adjust the weight vector, the learning algorithm computes a gradient vector that, for each weight, indicates by what amount the error would increase or decrease if the weight were increased by a tiny amount.  Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech. In practice, most practitioners use a procedure called stochastic gradient descent (SGD) This consists of showing the input vector for a few examples, computing the outputs and the errors, and computing the average gradient for those examples, and adjusting the weights accordingly. The negative gradient vector indicates the direction of steepest descent in this landscape, taking it closer to a minimum, where the output error is low on average.  Since the 1960s we have known that linear classifiers can only carve their input space into very simple regions, namely half-spaces separated by a hyperplane19. Problems such as image and speech recognition require the input–output function to be insensitive to irrelevant variations of the input, such as variations in position, orientation or illumination of an object, or variations in the pitch or accent of speech. At the pixel level, images of two Samoyeds in different poses and in different environments may be very different from each other, whereas two images of a Samoyed and a wolf in the same position and on similar backgrounds may be similar to each other.  The chain rule of derivatives tells us how two small effects (that of a small change of x on y on y, and that of y on z) are composed. Substituting one equation into the other gives the chain rule. It also works when x, y and z are vectors (and the derivatives are Jacobian matrices) For simplicity, we have omitted bias terms. At each layer, we first compute the total input z to each unit, which is a weighted sum of the output of the units in the layer below. Then a non-linear function f(.) is applied to z to get the output.  Non-linear functions used in neural networks include the rectified linear unit (ReLU) f(z) = max(0,z), commonly used in recent years. At each hidden layer we compute the error derivative with respect to the output of each unit. The error-derivative for the weight wjk on the connection from unit j in the layer below is just yj ∂E/∂zk. raw pixels could not possibly distinguish the latter two.  Deep-learning architecture is a multilayer stack of simple modules, all (or most) of which are subject to learning. Each module in the stack transforms its input to increase both the selectivity and the invariance of the representation. With multiple non-linear layers, say a depth of 5 to 20, a system can implement extremely intricate functions of its inputs that are simultaneously sensitive to minute details — distinguishing Samoyeds from white wolves — and insensitive to large irrelevant variations.\n",

            " Multilayer networks can be trained by simple stochastic gradient descent. As long as the modules are relatively smooth functions of their inputs and of their internal weights, one can compute gradients using the backpropagation procedure. The idea that this could be done, and that it worked, was discovered independently by several different groups during the 1970s and 1980s. Many applications of deep learning use feedforward neural network architecture (Fig. 1), which learn to map a fixed-size input (for example, an image) to a fixed size output.  In the late 1990s, neural nets and backpropagation were largely forsaken by the machine-learning community and ignored by the computer-vision and speech-recognition communities. Recent theoretical and empirical results strongly suggest that local minima are not a serious issue in general in general. The hidden layers can be seen as distorting the input in a non-linear way so that categories become linearly separable by the last layer (Fig. 1), such as hidden layers.  Interest in deep feedforward networks was revived around 2006 (refs 31–34) by a group of researchers brought together by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) The analysis seems to show that saddle points with only a few downward curving directions are present in very large numbers. Almost all of these saddle points have very similar values of the objective function. Hence, it does not much matter which of the saddle points the algorithm gets stuck at. Information flows bottom up with lower-level features acting as oriented edge detectors, and a score is computed for each image class in output.  In 2009, the approach was used to map short temporal windows of coefficients extracted from a sound wave to a set of probabilities for the various fragments of speech that might be represented by the frame in the centre of the window. It achieved record-breaking results on a standard speech recognition benchmark that used a small vocabulary. By 2012, versions of the deep net from 2009 were being developed by many of the major speech groups and were already being deployed in Android phones. For smaller data sets, unsupervised pre-training helps to prevent overfitting40, leading to significantly better generalization.  Convolutional neural network (ConvNet) achieved many successes during the period when neural networks were out of favour. It has recently been widely adopted by the computervision community.\n",

            " Deep-learning theory shows that deep nets have two different exponential advantages over classic learning algorithms that do not use distributed representations21. Both of these advantages arise from the power of composition and depend on the underlying data-generating distribution having an appropriate componential structure40. The hidden layers of a multilayer neural network learn to represent the network’s inputs in a way that makes it easy to predict the target outputs. Figure 3 | From image to text. Captions generated by a recurrent neural network taking, as extra input, the representation extracted by a deep convolution neural network from a test image.  Each word in the context is presented to the network as a one-of-N vector, that is, one component has a value of 1 and the rest are 0. The network learns word vectors that contain many active components each of which can be interpreted as a separate feature of the word. In a language model, the other layers of the network learn to convert the input word vectors into an output word vector for the predicted next word. These word vectors are composed of learned features that were not determined ahead of time by experts, but automatically discovered by the neural network.  In the logic-inspired paradigm, an instance of a symbol is something for which the only property is that it is either identical or non-identical to other symbols. By contrast, neural networks just use big activity vectors, big weight matrices and scalar non-linearities to perform the type of fast ‘intuitive’ inference that underpins effortless commonsense reasoning.

            " For tasks that involve sequential inputs, such as speech and language, it is often better to use RNNs. Backpropagation was first introduced to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) But training them has proved to be problematic because the backpropagated gradients either grow or shrink at each time step, so over many time steps they typically explode or vanish77,78. When we consider the output of the hidden units at different discrete time steps as if they were the outputs of different neurons in a deep multilayer network, it becomes clear how we can apply backPropagation to train Rnns.  This rather naive way of performing machine translation has quickly become competitive with the state-of-the-art. This raises serious doubts about whether understanding a sentence requires anything like the internal symbolic expressions that are manipulated by using inference rules. It is more compatible with the view that everyday reasoning involves many simultaneous analogies of word representations learned for modelling language, non-linearly projected to 2D for visualization using the t-SNE algorithm103. Instead of translating meaning of a French sentence into an English sentence, one can learn to ‘translate’ the meaning of an image.  The encoder is a deep ConvNet that converts pixels into an activity vector in its last hidden layer. The decoder is an RNN similar to the ones used for machine translation and neural language modelling. LSTM networks have subsequently proved to be more effective than conventional RNNs, especially when they have several layers for each time step87, enabling an entire speech recognition system that goes all the way from acoustics to the sequence of characters in the transcription.  LSTM networks or related forms of gated units are also currently used for the encoder and decoder networks that perform so well at machine translation17,72,76. Proposals include the Neural Turing Machine in which the network is augmented by a ‘tape-like’ memory that the RNN can choose to read from or write to88, and memory networks. Memory networks have yielded excellent performance on standard question-answering benchmarks.\n",

            "Accurate estimation of duration of surgery (DOS) can lead to cost-effective utilization of surgical staff and operating rooms and decrease patients’ waiting time. In this study, we present a supervised DOS nonlinear regression prediction model whose accuracy outperforms earlier results. In addition, unlike previous studies, we identify the features that influence DOS prediction. Further, in difference from others, we study the causal relationship between the feature set and DOS. The feature sets used in prior studies included a subset of the features presented in this study. This study aimed to derive influential effectors of duration of surgery via optimized prediction and causality analysis. We implemented an array of machine learning algorithms and trained them on datasets comprising surgery-related data, to derive DOS prediction models. The datasets we acquired contain patient, surgical staff, and surgery features. The datasets comprised 23,293 surgery records of eight surgery types performed over a 10-year period in a public hospital. We have introduced new, unstudied features and combined them with features adopted from previous studies to generate a comprehensive feature set. We utilized feature importance methods to identify the influential features, and causal inference methods to identify the causal features. Our model demonstrates superior performance in comparison to DOS prediction models in the art. The performance of our DOS model in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) was 14.9 minutes. The algorithm that derived the model with the best performance was the gradient boosted trees (GBT). We identified the 10 most influential features and the 10 most causal features. In addition, we showed that 40% of the influential features have a significant (p-value = 0.05) causal relationship with DOS. We developed a DOS prediction model whose accuracy is higher than that of prior models. This improvement is achieved via the introduction of a novel feature set on which the model was trained. Utilizing our prediction model, hospitals can improve the efficiency of surgery schedules, and by exploiting the identified causal relationship, can influence the DOS. Further, the feature importance methods we used can help explain the model’s predictions.\n",

            " High cost of surgeries and operating rooms (ORs) have made them key elements for hospital administrators looking to streamline expenses. OR underutilization results in negative consequences such as staff idle time, increased patient waiting times for surgeries, and more. OR overutilization might overload the staff, increase patient waiting time and dissatisfaction, generate disorder, increase the probability of human error. Current practices suggest that physicians who are hospital staff members schedule the surgeries. As shown in the art, however, physicians tend to predict DOS inaccurately, thus causing sub-optimal scheduling.  ML techniques are widely used in health informatics studies. With the increase in surgery documentation in electronic health records, ML has become very relevant for DOS prediction. Explaining predictions produced by ML models is a necessary element of ML research in healthcare [12] Explaining the importance of each feature to the model sheds light on the model’s behavior. Such understanding allows domain experts, i.e., physicians and surgeons, to validate the model's predictions and gives them a tool for optimizing surgery management.  Causal inference addresses the problem of identifying cause and effect relationships in data [17] and has a central role in healthcare [19] Unlike previous studies, our focus is on the importance of features and the effect of that importance on the model and the predicted DOS. Our models provide a prediction for both the elective and the emergency surgery classes. We study a broad range of patient features (age, gender, BMI, etc. ) and surgical staff features. In addition, we use explanatory algorithms to analyze our model’s predictions and causal inference algorithms.  Using our prediction model, OR management teams can improve the performance of surgery scheduling in terms of patient waiting time and surgery team idle time. This study has several OR management implications. Using the identified causal relationships, OR teams can control and adjust DOS values. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the state-of-the-art, the motivation for this study, and its objectives.\n",

Since our study is observational, the ATE values could not be computed accurately, as a feature in a surgery record only has an observed value and cannot be assigned other values [29] We use Eq (1) and its extensions to calculate ATE. Two main ML model types, propensity and heterogeneity models, are used for estimating causal effects.  The propensity score is the probability of a record to have a particular feature value given a set of observed other features. Propensity scores are used to reduce confounding variables’ effects and the implied bias. The latter models are used for estimating the heterogeneity of the treatment effect [31] To develop the heterogeneity model, we used forest-based algorithms.\n",

We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. We show that the introduction of. semantics into funding. prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. The introduction of semantics into.

            "Text:Accurate estimation of duration of surgery (DOS) can lead to cost-effective utilization of surgical staff and operating rooms and decrease patients’ waiting time. In this study, we present a supervised DOS nonlinear regression prediction model whose accuracy outperforms earlier results. In addition, unlike previous studies, we identify the features that influence DOS prediction. Further, in difference from others, we study the causal relationship between the feature set and DOS. The feature sets used in prior studies included a subset of the features presented in this study. This study aimed to derive influential effectors of duration of surgery via optimized prediction and causality analysis. We implemented an array of machine learning algorithms and trained them on datasets comprising surgery-related data, to derive DOS prediction models. The datasets we acquired contain patient, surgical staff, and surgery features. The datasets comprised 23,293 surgery records of eight surgery types performed over a 10-year period in a public hospital. We have introduced new, unstudied features and combined them with features adopted from previous studies to generate a comprehensive feature set. We utilized feature importance methods to identify the influential features, and causal inference methods to identify the causal features. Our model demonstrates superior performance in comparison to DOS prediction models in the art. The performance of our DOS model in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) was 14.9 minutes. The algorithm that derived the model with the best performance was the gradient boosted trees (GBT)  We identified the 10 most influential features and the 10 most causal features. In addition, we showed that 40% of the influential features have a significant (p-value = 0.05) causal relationship with DOS. We developed a DOS prediction model whose accuracy is higher than that of prior models. This improvement is achieved via the introduction of a Novel column (novel) feature set on which the model was trained. Utilizing our prediction model, hospitals can improve the efficiency of surgery schedules, and by exploiting the identified causal relationship, can influence the DOS. Further, the feature importance methods we used can help explain the model’s predictions.\n",

Two main machine learning (ML) model types, propensity and heterogeneity models, are used for estimating causal effects.  The propensity score is the probability of a record to have a particular feature value given a set of observed other features.

In this study, we present a supervised DOS nonlinear regression prediction model whose accuracy outperforms earlier results. In addition, unlike previous studies, we identify the features that influence DOS prediction. Further, in difference from others, we study the causal relationship between the feature set and DOS. The feature sets used in prior studies included a subset of the features presented in this study. This study aimed to derive influential effectors of duration of surgery via optimized prediction and causality analysis. We implemented an array of machine learning algorithms and trained them on datasets comprising surgery-related data, to derive DOS prediction models. The datasets we acquired contain patient, surgical staff, and surgery features. The datasets comprised 23,293 surgery records of eight surgery types performed over a 10-year period in a public hospital. We have introduced new, unstudied features and combined them with features adopted from previous studies to generate a comprehensive feature set. We utilized feature importance methods to identify the influential features, and causal inference methods to identify the causal features. Our model demonstrates superior performance in comparison to DOS prediction models in the art. The performance of our DOS model in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) was 14.9 minutes. The algorithm that derived the model with the best performance was the gradient boosted trees (GBT)  We identified the 10 most influential features and the 10 most causal features. In addition, we showed that 40% of the influential features have a significant (p-value = 0.05) causal relationship with DOS. We developed a DOS prediction model whose accuracy is higher than that of prior models. This improvement is achieved via the introduction of a Novel column (novel) feature set on which the model was trained. Utilizing our prediction model, hospitals can improve the efficiency of surgery schedules, and by exploiting the identified causal relationship, can influence the DOS. Further, the feature importance methods we used can help explain the model’s predictions.\n",

            "Text: High cost of surgeries and operating rooms (ORs) have made them key elements for hospital administrators looking to streamline expenses. OR underutilization results in negative consequences such as staff idle time, increased patient waiting times for surgeries, and more. OR overutilization might overload the staff, increase patient waiting time and dissatisfaction, generate disorder, increase the probability of human error. Current practices suggest that physicians who are hospital staff members schedule the surgeries. As shown in the art, however, physicians tend to predict duration of surgery (DOS) inaccurately, thus causing sub-optimal scheduling.  machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used in health informatics studies. With the increase in surgery documentation in electronic health records, ML has become very relevant for DOS prediction. Explaining predictions produced by ML models is a necessary element of ML research in healthcare [12] Explaining the importance of each feature to the model sheds light on the model’s behavior. Such understanding allows domain experts, i.e., physicians and surgeons, to validate the model's predictions and gives them a tool for optimizing surgery management.  Causal inference addresses the problem of identifying cause and effect relationships in data [17] and has a central role in healthcare [19] Unlike previous studies, our focus is on the importance of features and the effect of that importance on the model and the predicted DOS. Our models provide a prediction for both the elective and the emergency surgery classes. We study a broad range of patient features (age, gender, BMI, etc. ) and surgical staff features. In addition, we use explanatory algorithms to analyze our model’s predictions and causal inference algorithms.  Using our prediction model, OR management teams can improve the performance of surgery scheduling in terms of patient waiting time and surgery team idle time. This study has several OR management implications. Using the identified causal relationships, OR teams can control and adjust DOS values. The paper proceeds as follows.

In this study, we present a supervised DOS nonlinear regression prediction model whose accuracy outperforms earlier results. In addition, unlike previous studies, we identify the features that influence DOS prediction. Further, in difference from others, we study the causal relationship between the feature set and DOS. The feature sets used in prior studies included a subset of the features presented in this study. This study aimed to derive influential effectors of duration of surgery via optimized prediction and causality analysis. We implemented an array of machine learning algorithms and trained them on datasets comprising surgery-related data, to derive DOS prediction models. The datasets we acquired contain patient, surgical staff, and surgery features. The datasets comprised 23,293 surgery records of eight surgery types performed over a 10-year period in a public hospital. We have introduced new, unstudied features and combined them with features adopted from previous studies to generate a comprehensive feature set. We utilized feature importance methods to identify the influential features, and causal inference methods to identify the causal features. Our model demonstrates superior performance in comparison to DOS prediction models in the art. The performance of our DOS model in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) was 14.9 minutes. The algorithm that derived the model with the best performance was the gradient boosted trees (GBT)  We identified the 10 most influential features and the 10 most causal features. In addition, we showed that 40% of the influential features have a significant (p-value = 0.05) causal relationship with DOS. We developed a DOS prediction model whose accuracy is higher than that of prior models. This improvement is achieved via the introduction of a Novel column (novel) feature set on which the model was trained.

OR underutilization results in negative consequences such as staff idle time, increased patient waiting times for surgeries, and more. OR overutilization might overload the staff, increase patient waiting time and dissatisfaction, generate disorder, increase the probability of human error. Current practices suggest that physicians who are hospital staff members schedule the surgeries. As shown in the art, however, physicians tend to predict duration of surgery (DOS) inaccurately, thus causing sub-optimal scheduling.  machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used in health informatics studies. With the increase in surgery documentation in electronic health records, ML has become very relevant for DOS prediction. Explaining predictions produced by ML models is a necessary element of ML research in healthcare [12] Explaining the importance of each feature to the model sheds light on the model’s behavior. Such understanding allows domain experts, i.e., physicians and surgeons, to validate the model's predictions and gives them a tool for optimizing surgery management.  Causal inference addresses the problem of identifying cause and effect relationships in data [17] and has a central role in healthcare [19] Unlike previous studies, our focus is on the importance of features and the effect of that importance on the model and the predicted DOS. Our models provide a prediction for both the elective and the emergency surgery classes. We study a broad range of patient features (age, gender, BMI, etc. ) and surgical staff features. In addition, we use explanatory algorithms to analyze our model’s predictions and causal inference algorithms.  Using our prediction model, OR management teams can improve the performance of surgery scheduling in terms of patient waiting time and surgery team idle time. This study has several OR management implications. Using the identified causal relationships, OR teams can control and adjust DOS values. The paper proceeds as follows.

            "Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have.\n",
            "Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort\n",
            "Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests.\n",
            "So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.\n",

The computers help them keep more accurate records so they can make better decisions on what crops to plant, how much livestock to buy, when to sell their products, and how much profit they can expect. Many computer companies have been developing special computer programs just for farmers. Programs are being written for hog  producers, grain farmers, potato farmers, and dairy farmers. In the future, farmers will be able to purchase computer programs made to their needs. Because of the growing importance of computers on the farm, students at agricultural colleges are required to take computer classes in addition to their normal agricultural courses. There can be no doubt that farmers will rely on computers even more in the future. While the old-time farm depended on horse power, and modern farms depend on machine power, farms of the future will depend on computer power.\n",

Unlike farmers of the present, farmers of the future will find that many day-to-day tasks will be done for them. Scientists are now developing robots that will be able to shear  sheep, drive tractors, and harvest fruit. Even complex jobs will be done by robots. For example, in order to milk their cows, farmers must first drive them into the special barn , then connect them to the milking machines, watch the machines, and disconnect them when they are finished. In the future, this will all be done by robots. In addition, when the milking is completed, the robots will automatically check to make sure that the milk is pure.

            "Text:By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4] In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal) Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. We show that the introduction of. semantics into funding. prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. The introduction of semantics into.  This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well.\n",

        "q1 = \"Text: According to Andrew, it never would have happened if he had not had a flat tire on Highway 10 last night at about 7:30. He was on his way to attend a three-day sales meeting when he had the flat. tyre. Unfortunately, he did not have a spare, so he pushed the car off the road, locked it up, and managed to thumb a ride back to Pine Grove. It was after eleven o'clock when he finally got home, and it was then that his real problems started. When Andrew left home at about 5:30, he had told his wife not to expect him back until Thursday or Friday. Knowing that his wife was nervous about staying in the house alone at night, Andrew took the precaution of checking all the windows in the house to be sure they were locked, so that he could report to his wife that the house was secure. He convinced his wife that the house was burglar-proof, and that she would be perfectly safe, providing she bolted the front door as soon as he drove away. Andrew's only thought as he made his way in the dark to his front door was how surprised his wife was going to be to see him, since he was not supposed to be back until Thursday or Friday. He had forgotten about the bolt on the front door. When he turned his key in the lock and the door wouldn't _ he remembered the bolt. And he remembered that he had carefully locked all of the windows. Although Andrew didn't know it at the time, a next-door neighbor had seen him approaching the house and had watched him go up the steps to the front door. In the dark, it was impossible for the neighbor to recognize Andrew, and, besides, the neighbor knew that Andrew had gone out-of-town for a three-day meeting. As a matter of fact, Andrew had asked the neighbor to keep an eye on the house while he was gone. Finding that he couldn't get in, Andrew began pounding on the front door to get his wife to open the door. According to Andrew, however, his wife is a very sound sleeper, and he knew it was going to be hard to wake her up. In the meantime, because of all the noise he had been making, the neighbor was convinced that somebody was trying to break into the house; so she called the police. When we talked to Andrew at the country jail this morning, he said that he still didn't understand how the police managed to circle the house without his seeing them. He stated that he had decided the only way to get in was to break one of the dining room windows, and that he was about, to hurl his briefcase into the window to break it when two of the officers grabbed him from behind. Andrew could not make the officers believe that he lived there; so they took him off to jail. Apparently, he did succeed in convincing them that they ought to wake up the woman in the house to check his story. But there was no answer when they knocked at the door. He tried to explain to them that his wife was a very sound sleeper, but they concluded there was nobody in the house. \\n \" +\\\n",

        "q2 = \"Text: School is out for the summer in some areas, and for many children, that means weeks of sleeping in late, trips to the swimming pool or hours spent in front of the TV. These months of inactivity--- away from the daily tiring things of school--- are something that young people look forward to, but it can have a detrimental influence on the knowledge they have. Studies have shown that children lose a lot in math skills during the summer months. Children who spend little time learning experience a much greater amount of learning loss than those who often take part in summer programs. So when school starts again in the fall, teachers often have to spend several weeks reteaching children material that they have forgotten. Experts suggest that parents make sure the summer months are a time of continued learning. For example, they suggest that lunch time is good time to improve a child's spoken skills, simply through conversation. A trip to the supermarket can be an opportunity to improve a child's math skills by having him or her add up the cost of food. And there is no better way to prevent learning loss than by having a child read every day. Fortunately, there are many programs that can help parents. The best place to start is at your local library. Most libraries have summer reading programs that are filled with fun activities. A. strong musical education also improves learning. Find out summer music camps in your area. We think that children should have fun during the summer break, but it should not be a vacation from learning. We strongly suggest parents should take advantage of the many educational opportunities available for their children during the coming weeks. \\n \"+\\\n",

        "q3 = \"Text: Nelson Mandela was a figure of international fame, and many details of his life and career were public knowledge. But here are four things you may not have known about the late South African leader. 1. He was a boxing fan. In his youth, Nelson Mandela enjoyed boxing and long-distance running. Even during the 27 years he spent in prison, he would exercise every morning. \"I did not enjoy the violence of boxing so much as the science of it. I was curious by how one moved one's body to protect oneself, how one used a strategy both to attack and retreat, how one paced oneself over a match,\" he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. 2. His original name was not Nelson. Rolihlahla Mandela was nine years old when a teacher at the primary Methodist school where he was studying in Qunu, South Africa, gave him an English name \"Nelson\" in accordance with the custom to give all school children Christian names. 3. He forgot his glasses when he was released from prison. Mr. Mandela's release on 11 February 1990 followed years of political pressure against apartheid . Mr. Mandela's reading glasses stayed behind in prison Mr. Mandela and his then-wife Winnie were taken to the centre of Cape Town to address a huge and exciting crowd. But when he pulled out the text of his speech, he realized he had forgotten his glasses and had to borrow Winnie's. 4. He had his own law firm, but it took him years to get a law degree. Mr. Mandela studied law on and off for 50 years from 1939, failing about half the courses he took. A two-year diploma in law on top of his university degree allowed him to practice, and in August 1952, he and Oliver Tambo set up South Africa's first black law firm, Mandela and Tambo, in Johannesburg. He kept on studying hard to finally secure a law degree while in prison in 1989. \\n \"+\\\n",
        "\"Question: Why did Nelson Mandela love boxing? \\n (A) Because he wanted to be a boxer. \\n (B) Because he enjoyed the violence of boxing. \\n (C) Because he appreciated the strategy in boxing. \\n (D) Because he had nothing else to do in the prison. \\n Correct Answer is C.\"\n",

        "q4 = \"Text: New research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that people who struggle with mood problems or addiction can safely quit smoking and that kicking the habit is associated with improved mental health. Cavazos-Rehg, an assistant professor of psychiatry, found that quitting or significantly cutting back on cigarette smoking was linked to improved mental health outcomes. Quitting altogether or reducing by half the number of cigarettes smoked daily was associated with lower risk for mood disorders like depression, as well as a lower likelihood of alcohol and drug problems. \"We don't know if their mental health improves first and then they are more motivated to quit smoking or if quitting smoking leads to an improvement in mental health,\" Cavazos-Rehg said. \"But either way, our findings show a strong link between quitting and a better psychiatric outlook.\" In addition, she believes the serious health risks associated with smoking make it important for doctors to work with their patients to quit, regardless of other psychiatric problems. \"About half of all smokers die from related to smoking, so we need to remember that as complicated as it can be to treat mental health issues, smoking cigarettes also causes very serious illnesses that can lead to death,\" she explained. Cavazos-Rehg and her team analyzed questionnaires gathered as part of the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions. In the early 2000s, just under 35,000 people were surveyed. As part of the study, they answered questions about drinking, smoking and mental health in two interviews conducted three years apart. The researchers focused on data from 4,800 daily smokers. Those who had addiction or other psychiatric problems at the time of the first survey were less likely to have those same problems three years later if they had quit smoking. And those who hadn't had psychiatric problems at the initial survey were less likely to develop those problems later if they already had quit. \"We really need to spread the word and encourage doctors and patients to tackle these problems,\" Cavazos-Rehg said. \"When a patient is ready to focus on other mental health issues, it may be an ideal time to address smoking cessation, too. \\n\"+\\\n",
