Three main parties are involved in crowdfunding: entrepreneurs (and their projects), individuals or groups who support the project, and online platforms, ie., crowdfunding websites [1]. The latter bring together entrepreneurs and supporters to facilitate project funding and launching. There are many crowdfunding websites, of which the most popular ones are Kickstarter and Indiegogo [2]. By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding [3]. The average success rate of funded crowdfunding projects in Kickstarter is 37.5% [4]. In this paper, we refer to a project as a funding success (FS) if it achieved its funding goal (Le, it raised atleast 100% of the funding goal). L. acl g With the growth in popularity and scale of crowdfunding, achieving success in funding has attracted much popular and scientific attention. Studies have examined properties of successful projects, developed models of such projects, and tried to predict success based on those models. For example [5], examined the type of funding requested and its effect on funding success. In [6], the authors examined the effect of social engagement on success. Work in [7] studied the meta-data features that explain funding success, and based on the meta-data features they developed a prediction model for funding success. While models in the art rely on metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, they seldom consider semantic features. As we show, this lack negatively affects prediction accuracy. In this study we aim to improve prediction accuracy. To do that, we focus on extraction and analysis of semantic aspects of project posts. In contrast to prior studies, we take a more comprehensive approach to studying and predicting funding success. Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on the semantics of the projects\u2019 text. We use semantic features extracted from the text to build a predictive model of funding success. Further, to increase the accuracy of our results, we incorporate already known features that affect funding success. This approach leverages known results and improves upon them to provide high-quality funding success prediction. As we demonstrate, the introduction of semantics into funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method. Projects seeking crowdfunding range from one-time events to starting up small companies. Accordingly, these projects differ in terms of the requested investment amount and the type of compensation promised to investors. There are four primary types of crowdfunding [5,8,9]: . Reward crowdfunding: Investors contribute in return for non-financial benefits. . Debt crowdfunding: Investors fund projects as lenders and are paid interest on their investment. . Equity crowdfunding: Investors receive a return on investment by being offered private company securities. . Donation crowdfunding: This type is designed for charities or those who raise money for social or charitable projects, enabling them to gather an online community to donate to 4 project. Our main research objective is to find with a focus on semantic characteristics, which affect the success of a project in meeting its funding goal via crowdfunding. Our second objective is to answer the following questions: Given a dataset of crowdfunding projects\u2019 details as input, consisting of text such as project description, non-text metadata such as project category, funding, etc, can we predict the success of projects in meeting their funding goals? At what level of accuracy? How would diverse learning algorithms affect this accuracy? Achieving these research objectives should provide new insights into the relationship between crowdfunding project\u2019s data and their funding success. In addition, this should provide entrepreneurs with additional and desirable ways to improve their chances of reaching their funding goals. The study offers five main contributions. First, we demonstrate the important role of project\u2019s semantic properties in the project meeting its fundraising goals. To this end, we perform a comprehensive semantic analysis of the project\u2019s description, including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC [10], and others. Second, we present a novel model which is based on semantic features only, referred to as that predicts the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. We show that the accuracy of the semantic-model (in terms of F-score and correctly classified instances) is comparable to the accuracy of models which are based on metadata features such as the number of updates, the number of images, etc Third, building upon our new insights regarding project semantics, we introduce an additional prediction model that combines semantics and project metadata, referred to as Fourth, we show that semantic features including buzzwords and LIWC are among the highly correlate features with the project\u2019s success in fund raising. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, our research relies on the largest dataset used to date for developing models that predict funding success of crowdfunding projects. The dataset used included 160,125 project records from the two biggest crowdfunding websites. Even after filtering records of lesser relevance, 111,273 project records were still included in the analysis. \u2018This allows us to deliver a very accurate prediction model with very low error levels. In addition to the scientific contributions listed above, we provide a set of recommendations that may increase project funding success chances. These are based on the results of our study and of earlier studies as well. The semantic analysis introduced in this study is applicable beyond the specific domain examined here. Utilizing such analysis, one could study the effect of semantic properties of textual data on various target readerships. In our research, the textual data analyzed was the crowdfunding projects\u2019 description, and the target audience was individuals and groups that support the project. Another application domain could be, e.g, one where social network posts of an organization are analyzed to examine the level of support exhibited by its followers. The paper proceeds as follows. The Introduction section presents the the motivation for this study, and its objectives. The Background section presents background in crowdfunding as well as semantic analysis on which the study is built. The Methodology section focuses on the research methodology applied, including the acquisition of our dataset, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection. The Results Section presents the empirical evaluation of our research model and discusses the results. It further compares our models to models in earlier studies. Finally, in the Conclusion and Future Work section we summarize and discuss the main findings and point at future directions of our research.","title":"Introduction"},"summary":{"text":"By 2020, 34 billion dollars were raised by crowdfunding.

We also present the metric used to measure the accuracy of the models. For semantic analysis, the projects\u2019 textual data is required. Hence, a major data source used in this study is crowdfunding projects\u2019 posts. Such posts typically comprise multiple elements, including (but not limited to): title, subtitle, category, FAQ, project description, video, funding goal, time to achieve the goal, money raised, contact information, updates, backers, support ways and the names of the entrepreneurs or company. Our semantic analysis including topic analysis using LDA, word usage analysis using LIWC and novel features including the use of buzzwords, feeling words and explanation words.\nThe analysis we performed on posts examined their use of buzzwords [15]. Although some studies examined the use of buzzwords in project texts, the relationship between funding success and buzzwords used in the description of the project was not examined. This is a novel contribution of our research. The buzzword dataset used in this study contains words from different categories: general conversation, education, business, sales and marketing, science and technology, politics, and current affairs. Example buzzwords from the technology domain may be big data, cloud computing, opensource, etc In our study, the buzzwords feature was the percentage contribution of the words in the buzzword dataset to each input text ie, project\u2019s description.","title":"Background & Buzzwords"},"summary":{"text":"For semantic analysis, the projects\u2019 textual data is required.

LIWC includes text analysis software along with a group of built-in dictionaries [10]. Example of dictionaries are (* denotes stems): + Negative emotion: abuse\u2019, sorry, fury, tears, painf*, tragic\u2019, etc + Positive emotion: accept, funn\", ador*, pleasant\u2019, glad, etc The LIWC analysis measures the appearance of dictionary words in a specific text. The measure is a numeric value in the range [0..1]. It reflects the degree to which the text being analyzed is related to the theme of the dictionary. Specifically, the analysis works as follows. Ni-= the number words in the description text T and My = {w;,.,1y}, the set of n words in dictionary D. Accordingly, let N, = the number of occurrences of the word w from Mp in T. Sp = Yi= 1\u00bb Nwiis the sum of N,y over all words w in Mp. The output of LIWC is Vp = Sp/Nr. This value is the value of the feature that corresponds to D. In practice, Vip measures the frequency of appearance of words (and their stems) from a specific dictionary D in the examined text. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LIWC to analyze the textual description part of projects (though they did not look for buzzwords) and arrived at high model accuracies (eg, F-score > 0.8) [14]. The main difference between the present research and those studies is that the number and diversity of features in our study are much larger than previously published, and our dataset is significantly greater as well. As a result, we arrive at much higher model accuracy.","title":"Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)"},"summary":{"text":"To extract features from the text, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software tool.

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling [14]. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. Within a topic to which it belongs, the word has a weight that expresses its importance in the context of that topic. A topic is expressed by the set of words belonging to it and their associated weights. The value of the topic will be the sum of those weights. Onc\u00e9 the algorithm has a specified number of topics, it rearranges the distribution of the topics within the documents and the keyword distribution within the topics to obtain a good configu ration of the topic-keyword distribution [14]. Previous studies on crowdfunding used LDA to perform topic analysis on the text of project updates, though on a much smaller and very specific dataset compared to our research [14]. Another study used LDA to analyze Chinese crowdfunding websites and arrived at an accuracy level (F-score) of 86.7%. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions, where each topic is a feature. We used the Gensim Python package LDA implementation (from github.com). The latter is known to run faster than other and it generates better topic segregation [16]. To execute LDA, we performed some preprocessing. First, we tokenized each sentence into alist of words, removing punctuation, unnecessary characters, email addresses, and names. Once this was completed, we defined functions that remove the stop words, which generate bigrams (two words frequently occurring together in the document) and perform lemmatization (the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed asa single item). The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. Model perplexity and topic coherence provide a convenient measure to judge how good a given topic model is [16]. To avoid overfitting, we varied the number of topics from 10 to 50 and chose the one that derived the highest coherence value and the smallest number of topics. We ran the LDA on three datasets (of which details are in the Methodology section) and derived three corresponding sets of topics. For each dataset, the input to the LDA was textual descriptions of the projects in that dataset. The output was a set of topics and the percentage contribution of each topic to each input text. In our study, every topic was considered as a feature for developing the prediction model, and the percentage contribution ofa topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic. There were 30 topics that derived the highest coherence for the All_D dataset, 15 for the Tech_D dataset, and 15 for the Market_D dataset.","title":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)"},"summary":{"text":"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used topic modeling method.

These metrics are calculated as follows:\nIn order to meet the objectives of this study, we have developed a knowledge discovery plan. \u2018The plan comprises four main parts: obtaining and preprocessing datasets; feature selection; data analysis based on machine learning models; and, finally, evaluation of the knowledge extracted by the models. We used a dataset of 50,000 Kickstarter and 50,000 Indiegogo projects. We obtained these data from the Kaggle website for 2018. Note that similarly to other studies in the field, we filtered out projects with fewer than 10 lines of description. The goal of such filtering is to avoid compromising the accuracy of the semantic analysis [14]. We also omitted from the dataset projects whose completion due date was still in the future. After filtering, we had 73,583 projects: 42,530 that achieved their funding goal (success = 1), and 31,050 projects that had not managed to achieve their funding goal (success = 0). After filtering the dataset, we used Beautifulsup (a Python web scraping package) to gain additional metadata features, such as, description content, number of updates, etc For each record in the dataset, we obtained the values of five metadata features and about 120 semantic features, including buzzwords, LIWC outputs, feelings words, explanation words, and LDA outputs. The values of the features were computed as described above. We removed LDA topics that overlapped with LIWC topics by comparing the topic sets. Whenever there was an overlap, LDA\u2019s topic X was subsumed into LIWC\u2019s We preprocessed the dataset via common methods (for example, conversion of an ordinal variable to a numerical one or dataset normalization) to adjust the data to the input requirements of the data analysis algorithms we used for deriving the model. + All_D: comprising all projects regardless of their category. + Market_D: comprising only projects on marketing and business. This division aims to address the following analysis goals. First, it facilitates improvement in the LDA topic coherence score. Second, it allows us to determine whether a category affects the features that are highly correlated with funding success. Third, to study the correlation between buzzwords and FS, it is preferable for datasets to be separated into specific subdomains (most buzzwords we used are indeed in these sub-domains). We utilized MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to examine the similarity among the datasets. The results show that the separation by category causes statistical significance of the mean differences between the features using p-value = 0.05. We computed the Pearson correlation between all of the features we studied and the FS. All of the models and the correlation values were computed, separately, with respect to the three datasets. To increase we wanted to visualize the feature space and its general data structure. For this, we had to reduce the space to a space. Thus, we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most influential features [25,26]. Following this analysis, for each dataset, the original features space was reduced into three Principal Components (PCs), as visualized in Fig 1. The sum of the explained variance ratio of these three PCs is 78% of the total variance. combination of semantic and meta-data features. For each of the two models, we calculated the F-score as a measure of model\u2019s accuracy. We employed a 10-fold test to evaluate the prediction performance. This test has been used widely to validate the performance of models similar to ours [6,21,28]. For each fold, our data sample was randomly divided into 10 parts, then 10 experiments were performed, with nine parts used as training data for the predictive model to predict the remaining part. For each fold, we trained the LDA algorithm on the training data. The average prediction accuracy is reported. Our goal was to achieve an accuracy level greater than 90%.

The question of how different properties of the project's presentations can increase the chance of successful project funding is important. While previous studies have identified some metadata features and topic analysis for predicting crowdfunding success, little research was conducted to explore the semantic features in this context. In this study, we addressed this void. We focused on analysis of semantic aspects of project posts to improve the accuracy of funding success predictions. We designed a text analytics framework and developed a prediction model for analyzing and predicting crowdfunding success. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies. We also developed a prediction model with an impressive Fscore of 96.2%, focusing on both aspects and semantics of project descriptions.
