Formal care involves the services of community and medical partners, while informal care involves the support of family, friends, and local communities, but more often from spouses, adult children, and other relatives. In most mild to medium cases of dementia, the caregiver is a family member, usually a spouse or adult child. Over time, more professional care in the form of nursing and other supportive care may be required, whether at home or in a long-term care facility. There is evidence that case management can improve care for individuals with dementia and the experience of their caregivers. Furthermore, case management may reduce overall cost and institutional care in the medium term.

Respite also provides a positive experience for the person receiving care. The term \"short break\" is used in some countries to describe respite care.\nEven though many families take great joy in providing care to their loved ones so that they can remain at home, the physical, emotional and financial consequences for the family caregiver can be overwhelming without some support, such as respite. Respite provides a break for the family caregiver, which may prove beneficial to their health. Sixty percent of family caregivers age 19 to 64 recently surveyed by the Commonwealth Fund reported fair or poor health, one or more chronic conditions, or a disability, compared with only 33% of non-caregivers.\nRespite has been shown to help sustain family caregiver health and wellness, avoid or delay out-of-home placements, and reduce the likelihood of abuse and neglect.

Individuals engage in some form of self-care daily with food choices, exercise, sleep, and dental care. Self-care is not only a solo activity as the community\u2014a group that supports the person performing self-care\u2014overall plays a large role in access to, implementation of, and success of self-care activities. While the concept of self care has received increased attention in recent years, it has ancient origins. Socrates has been credited with founding the self-care movement in ancient Greece, and care are of oneself and loved ones has been shown to exist since human beings appeared on earth. Self-care has also been connected to the Black Feminist movement through civil rights activist and poet Audre Lorde. Self-care was used to preserve black feminist's identities, energize their activism, and preserve their minds during the civil rights movement. Self-care remains a primary form of personal and community healthcare worldwide; self-care practices vary greatly around the world.Routine self-care is important when someone is not experiencing any symptoms of illness, but self-care becomes essential when illness occurs. General benefits of routine self-care include prevention of illness, improved mental health, and comparatively better quality of life. Self-care practices can greatly vary from individual to individual as it is a very personal act. Self-care is seen as a partial solution to the global rise in health care costs that is placed on governments worldwide.A lack of self-care in terms of personal health, hygiene and living conditions is referred to as self-neglect. The use of caregivers and Personal Care Assistants may be needed. There is a growing body of knowledge related to these home care workers.There exists a close overlap between the term self-care and self-management introduced by Lorig and Holman. In their spearheading paper, they defined three self-management tasks: medical management, role manage- ment, and emotional management; and six self-management skills: problem solving, decision making, resource utilization, the formation of a patient\u2013provider partnership, action planning, and self-tailoring."}},"key":"self care","order":["0"],"using":true},{"data":{"0":{"tag":"NP","wiki":"A patient is any recipient of health care services that are performed by healthcare professionals.

Introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s, the term was adopted by the American Psychiatric Association for this symptom cluster under mood disorders in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), and has become widely used since.\nThe diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences, behavior reported by relatives or friends, and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for the disorder, but testing may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is in a person's 20s, with females affected about twice as often as males. The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting months to a lifelong disorder with recurrent major depressive episodes.\nThose with major depressive disorder are typically treated with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may be significant only in the most severely depressed. Hospitalization (which may be involuntary) may be necessary in cases with associated self-neglect or a significant risk of harm to self or others. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered if other measures are not effective.Major depressive disorder is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, with about 40% of the risk being genetic. Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance use disorders. It can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education, and cause issues with a person's sleeping habits, eating habits, and general health. Major depressive disorder affected approximately 163 million people (2% of the world's population) in 2017. The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France. Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world (15%) compared to the developing world (11%).

Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all constitute health care. It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.\nAccess to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means \"the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes\". Factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the possibility to take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).\nHealth systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.\nAn efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy, development, and industrialization. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world.

More severe behavioural, cognitive, and functional impairments in a patient are associated with higher levels of burden and distress. Distress increases with care hours per week, number of tasks, and declining coping and support resources. Demographic factors also aff ect levels of burden and distress. Promising, evidence-based interventions exist, but substantial economic and policy barriers preclude their widespread dissemination. Health-care policy makers should consider addressing these barriers; clinicians and families must campaign for reimbursement; and clinical researchers must develop more potent preventive interventions. In this article we review how dementia care aff ects the mental health of the carer and identify interventions that might be useful in mitigating carer burden and distress. There are nearly 18 million people with dementia in the world,1 and the number of adults that provide care to relatives with dementia is growing.2 8\u00b79 million people care for people with dementia3 in the USA, and on the basis of dementia rates, more than 750 000 people provide dementia care in the UK.1 Carers provide these unpaid services to society and their family members at substantial personal cost4 and risk to their own psychological and physical wellbeing. Morbidity is particularly high among carers of patients with dementia.5\u201310 These adverse eff ects are infl uenced by the carer\u2019s personal and demographic characteristics, coping resources, and available support resources. Other important considerations are the patient\u2019s level of impairment, the number of hours spent caring, and whether the carer is a spouse or adult child. Although the carer\u2019s wellbeing is not necessarily the responsibility of the patient\u2019s neurologist, caring is a clinical and socially relevant issue with which neurologists should be familiar, especially as recent evidence suggests that the carer\u2019s ability to cope eff ectively is associated with the patient\u2019s survival11 and time until institutionalisation.12 There are thousands of studies about dementia care.

In their discussion of the case of Elisabeth Von R, the authors expressed concern that \u201csick nursing\u201d could lead to sleep disturbance, self-neglect, and constant worry.39 Over the past decade, narrative reviews and meta-analyses provide substantial evidence for these clinical observations. Carers of people with dementia have more symptoms of depression, higher stress scores, lower self-effi cacy, and lower subjective wellbeing than non-carers.9 There are few studies about anxiety in dementia carers, but most have shown similar eff ects. For example, in a recent English study, almost 25% of carers had clinically signifi cant levels of anxiety symptoms.40 Several associated methodological issues must be considered when assessing research on carers\u2019 psychosocial outcomes. Most samples are not drawn randomly, nor are they followed prospectively. Two prospective studies show that for those transitioning to intensive caring roles, there is an increase over time in distress, health problems, and health-risk behaviour. However, before becoming carers, these individuals reported poorer health, lower mastery, and more depression symptoms than non-carers.41,42 Thus, carers may have self-selected themselves into the role or been selected into the role by someone else. These selection processes could indicate family dynamics or individual personality traits. High distress levels and attendant morbidity could partially be explained by personal or family variables that are not associated with the caring experience per se.43,44 Many studies of carers have not considered the eff ects of carer personality or other seemingly distal indicators of resources and vulnerabilities (eg, access to economic resources). Inadequate covariate coverage may lead to overestimates of the unique stressors of caregiving. Another issue that has received insuffi cient attention is whether the apparently adverse psychosocial outcomes are clinically (as opposed to statistically) signifi cant. There are three possible criteria for clinical signifi cance: scoring above clinical cut-off s for symptomatology or meeting diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder; measurably reduced quality of life of carers or patients; and increased health-care costs. The fi rst criterion is supported by the fact that a substantial proportion of carers score above clinical cut-off s for depression and anxiety.40 The prevalence of clinically diagnosed major depression ranges from 10%45,46 to 83%47 among carers in dementia. Both carers\u2019 raised levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress and their increased physical health and physiological risks suggest a low quality of life.24,48 Health-care costs are increased by greater physical health and mortality risks,49  Figure: Model of carer stress and burden reduced self-care behaviour,50 and increased nursing-home placement with high levels of burden.51,52.","title":"Are carers more distressed than non-carers?"},"summary":{"images":["https://testing-api.leminda.com/summary/2462/img/6671.png"],"text":" Carers of people with dementia have more symptoms of depression, higher stress scores, lower self-effi cacy, and lower subjective wellbeing than non-carers.

Psychotherapy includes individual or group-based psychodynamic, behavioural, and cognitive-behavioural therapy.105 Cognitive-behaviour therapy techniques are most common (90%) and help the carer focus on the identifi cation and modifi cation of unproductive beliefs and behaviours and the development of new behaviours to deal with the demands and emotions of caring.106 Psychoeducation is the structured presentation of information about dementia, expectable caring issues, stress management, and techniques to manage the patients\u2019 behaviour. This intervention may also include role playing and other active learning techniques.107 Support groups provide the opportunity to share personal feelings and concerns, encourage mutuality and validation, and overcome feelings of social isolation.108 Experts may be invited for brief periods to provide medical, legal, and other information. Respite off ers substitute care to provide planned, temporary relief to the carer, through group day care, inhome respite, or institutional respite (vacation or emergency respite).79,109 Training for the patient attempts to improve the social and everyday competence of patients with dementia.110 Pharmacotherapy for patients with dementia can reduce problem behaviour, improve activities of daily living, and stabilise cognitive impairment,100,111 which in turn may reduce carer burden.100 Pharmacotherapy for carers could reduce depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms.112 Multicomponent interventions involve combining components from diff erent interventions, such as education, support, and respite.113 Some interventions are structured to ensure that participants get all components, and others are less structured. There are other forms of interventions that are rarely used, such as life-review,114 yoga,115 employer-based interventions,116 telephone support groups,117 and new technologies.118.","title":"Types of interventions"},"summary":{"text":" Consultation or case management does not aim to change individuals\u2019 coping styles or beliefs.

Psychoeducational interventions are most eff ective at improving carer knowledge (medium eff ects), reducing burden and depression symptoms, and increasing subjective wellbeing and satisfaction (small eff ects). However, except for an increase in knowledge, these eff ects are present only if the interventions call for active participation and skill-building,23 for example, by combining educational components with homework and role-playing activities that help participants apply the newly gained skills.119 Psychoeducational interventions may improve the symptoms of the patient as well,22 perhaps, by training the carer to redirect the patient to avoid escalation of problem behaviour. Other interventions also have mostly small eff ects.120 Psychotherapy (primarily cognitive-behavioural therapy), support groups, consultation or case management, respite care, and cognitive training of the patient tend to have domain-specifi c eff ects. For example, psychotherapy improves carer burden, depression,23 and anxiety,121 but not necessarily knowledge about dementia; consultation or case management have moderate eff ects on burden, but not depression; training the patient aff ects the patient\u2019s symptoms but not the carer\u2019s; and respite care reduces burden and depression symptoms and increases subjective wellbeing.23 Because diff erent intervention types share elements (for example, homework and roleplaying are part of both psychotherapy and psychoeducation), a focus on the components may be more important than packaged programmes. Multicomponent treatments encompass a diverse group of programmes and some are substantially more systematic in their application of components than others. Our meta-analysis of 120 studies shows no eff ects of these approaches overall, but interventions that are well structured and expose participants to all components are eff ective in delaying nursing-home placement of patients.23,122 These programmes are probably eff ective because they target many of the primary stressors, secondary stressors, and moderators (fi gure). Four criteria have been suggested for clinical signifi cance of interventions:123 acceptability to those being treated (social validity), eff ects on symptoms, improved quality of life, and societal signifi cance. Social validity is fairly well documented, although high levels of carer satisfaction are sometimes associated with otherwise ineff ective inter ventions,124 so this criterion might not be particularly useful. Most studies of carer interventions do not report clinical diagnoses, but clinical eff ectiveness can be estimated by how large a symptom reduction the experimental group experiences compared with the control group. In our most recent meta-analysis, 54\u201357% of the participants showed above-average improvement in depression compared with 43\u201347% of control group members.23  Table 1: Comparison of the amount of carer distress relative to the size of eff ects of carer interventions Schulz and colleagues123 conclude that clinically signifi cant eff ects of interventions are most visible for reduction of depression, and, to a lesser degree anxiety symptoms. Improved quality of life is refl ected in increases in selfeffi cacy, subjective wellbeing, and reductions in perceived stress.20,23 Thus, the results are clinically and practically meaningful for both symptomatology and quality of life. However, improvements are modest in size and cost savings to society have rarely been assessed.125 Delaying institutionalisation addresses the issue of societal signifi cance, given the high societal cost of nursing-home care.126 One study11 suggests improved survival for patients when carers have more eff ective coping skills, showing the broader relevance of carer interventions. Another method of trying to understand the eff ect of interventions on patients is to compare the eff ect sizes for a given outcome with the magnitude of the diff erence between carers without the intervention and non-carers (table 1).9,23.","title":"Which interventions work?"},"summary":{"images":["https://testing-api.leminda.com/summary/2462/img/6672.png"],"text":" Meta-analyses suggest that carer interventions overall are eff ective, but that the eff ects are relatively small.
