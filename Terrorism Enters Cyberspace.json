Its members are mostly composed of Arabs, but may also include other peoples. Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on civilian and military targets in various countries, including the 1998 United States embassy bombings, the September 11 attacks, and the 2002 Bali bombings; it has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, India, and various other countries.\nThe network was founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and other Arab volunteers during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. After fighting the \"holy\" war, the group aimed to expand such operations to other parts of the world, setting up bases in parts of Africa, the Arab world and elsewhere, carrying out many attacks on people whom it considers k\u0101fir.Al-Qaeda members believe a Christian-Jewish alliance (led by the United States) is conspiring to be at war against Islam and destroy Islam. As Salafist jihadists, members of Al-Qaeda believe that killing non-combatants is religiously sanctioned. Al-Qaeda also opposes what it regards as man-made laws, and wants to replace them exclusively with a strict form of shar\u012b\u02bfa (Islamic religious law, which is perceived as divine law). It is also responsible for instigating sectarian violence among Muslims. Al-Qaeda regards liberal Muslims, Shias, Sufis, and other Islamic sects as heretical and its members and sympathizers have attacked their mosques, shrines, and gatherings. Examples of sectarian attacks include the 2004 Ashoura massacre, the 2006 Sadr City bombings, the April 2007 Baghdad bombings, and the 2007 Yazidi community bombings.The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the \"war on terror\", which sought to undermine Al-Qaeda and its allies. The deaths of key leaders, including that of Osama bin Laden, have led Al-Qaeda's operations to shift from top-down organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks carried out by a loose network of associated groups and lone-wolf operators. Al-Qaeda characteristically organizes attacks including suicide attacks and simultaneous bombing of several targets. Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the violent removal of all foreign and secular influences in Muslim countries, which it perceives as corrupt deviations. Following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011, the group was led by Egyptian Ayman al-Zawahiri until his death in 2022. As of 2021, it has reportedly suffered from a deterioration of central command over its regional operations."}},"key":"al Qaeda","order":["0"],"using":true},{"data":{"0":{"tag":"NP","wiki":"A number of national governments and two international organizations have created lists of organizations that they designate as terrorist.

The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.\nSocial networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\". Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s.

While challenges to the definition of social media arise due to the variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available, there are some common features:\nSocial media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.\nUser-generated content\u2014such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through all online interactions\u2014is the lifeblood of social media.\nUsers create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.\nSocial media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.The term social in regard to media suggests that platforms are user-centric and enable communal activity. As such, social media can be viewed as online facilitators or enhancers of human networks\u2014webs of individuals who enhance social connectivity.Users usually access social media services through web-based apps on desktops or download services that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these electronic services, they create highly interactive platforms which individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify user-generated or self-curated content posted online. Additionally, social media are used to document memories, learn about and explore things, advertise oneself, and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites. This changing relationship between humans and technology is the focus of the emerging field of technological self-studies. Some of the most popular social media websites, with more than 100 million registered users, include Facebook (and its associated Facebook Messenger), TikTok, WeChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, Twitter, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, and LinkedIn.  Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, VK, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.\nSocial media outlets differ from traditional media (e.g., print magazines and newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality, reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence. Additionally, social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system, i.e., many sources to many receivers, while traditional media outlets operate under a monologic transmission model (i.e., one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to an entire city.Since the dramatic expansion of the Internet, digital media or digital rhetoric can be used to represent or identify a culture. Studying how the rhetoric that exists in the digital environment has become a crucial new process for many scholars.\nObservers have noted a wide range of positive and negative impacts when it comes to the use of social media. Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or online communities and can be an effective communication (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments. Observers have also seen that there has been a rise in social movements using social media as a tool for communicating and organizing in times of political unrest."}},"key":"Social media platforms","order":["0"],"using":true},{"data":{"0":{"tag":"NP","wiki":"Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as edutech, or edtech) is the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning.

Since then, it has been applied to various insurgent Islamic extremist, militant Islamist, and terrorist individuals and organizations whose ideologies are based on the Islamic notion of jihad.

Terrorism in Cyberspace: The Next Generation Conflicts on the ground are echoed, as one can imagine, in cyberspace\u2026 Cyberspace offers even more fertile territory for sabotage, misinformation, and what in the clich\u00e9d formulation is termed the war over mind. Vinay Lal, Terror and Its Networks: Disappearing Trails in Cyberspace . Paradoxically, the most innovative network of communication developed by modern Western societies -- the Internet, with its numerous online networking platforms -- now serves the interests of the greatest foe of the West, namely international terrorism. Since the late 1980s, the Internet has proven to be a fast and efficient platform for the flow of communication, reaching an ever-growing audience worldwide. The constant development of increasingly sophisticated technologies has created a huge network with a global reach and relatively low barriers to entry. The benefits of online communication are numerous, starting with its unique suitability for sharing information and ideas. However, it should be noted, that the same technologies and platforms that facilitate such communication can also be exploited for the purposes of terrorism and extremism. This emerging pattern of online terrorism, using and abusing the Internet for terrorist purposes, creates both challenges and opportunities in the endless war against terrorism. The growing presence of modern terrorism on the Internet is at the nexus of two key trends: the democratization of communications driven by user-generated content on the Internet, and the growing awareness of modern terrorists of the potential of using the Internet as a tool for their purposes. Thus, the internet has long been a favorite tool of terrorists. Decentralized and providing almost perfect anonymity, it cannot be subjected to control or restriction, and allows access to anyone who wants it. Large or small, terrorist groups have their own websites, in which they use this medium to spread propaganda, raise funds, and seduce potential newcomers. Additionally, terrorists radicalize, recruit and train members, communicate and conspire, and plan and launch attacks online. Besides thousands of terrorist websites, modern terrorists rely on chatrooms, e-groups, forums, social networking, and online platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more (Weimann 2006a, 2011c, 2012a). In the late 1990s, terrorist movements made their first appearance on the Net (Tsfati and Weimann 2002). In July 2004, the independent National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission) released its findings in a 570-page report. In pursuing their mandate, the commission reviewed more than 2.5 million pages of documents and interviewed more than 1,200 individuals in ten countries. The report starts with a short conclusion: \"We learned about an enemy who is sophisticated, patient, disciplined, and lethal. The enemy rallies broad support in the Arab and Muslim world by demanding redress of political grievances, but its hostility toward us and our values is limitless.\" [1] The report points to the use of modern communication technologies for the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks: \"Terrorists, in turn, have benefited from this same rapid development of communication technologies\u2026The emergence of the World Wide Web has given terrorists a much easier means of acquiring information and exercising command and control over their operations.\" [2] [1] [2] The report highlights the uses of the Internet by the al-Qaeda operatives, including: searching the Web for information on U.S. flight schools, using Internet communications, equipping the hijackers with e-mail accounts, coordinating the attackers' actions using e-mails, downloading Anti-American Web pages and learning about flights from the Internet. Given this compatible relationship between the Internet and modern terrorism, the use and abuse of these new electronic communications and capabilities by terrorists is inevitable, as seen in the following chapters, which highlight the communicative and instrumental uses of the Internet by terrorists. The interactive capabilities of the Internet, like social networking sites, video-sharing sites, and online communities, allow terrorists to assume a proactive position. Instead of waiting for web-surfers to come across their websites and propaganda materials, terrorists can now lure targeted individuals to the sites. Online social networking provides terrorists with an ideal platform to attract and seduce, teach and train, radicalize and activate individuals all over the world. The Internet has provided terrorists with a whole new virtual realm to conduct their most sinister transactions. As numerous studies have revealed, most of the recent terrorists involved in the planning of attacks or the attacks themselves \u2013 were radicalized, recruited, trained and even launched \u2013 online (Weimann 2012b). The Council on Foreign Relations concluded its 2009 report on online terrorism: Terrorists increasingly are using the Internet as a means of communication both with each other and the rest of the world. By now, nearly everyone has seen at least some images from propaganda videos published on terrorist sites and rebroadcast on the world's news networks\u2026 The Internet is a powerful tool for terrorists, who use online message boards and chat rooms to share information, coordinate attacks, spread propaganda, raise funds, and recruit. [3] [3] As an illustrative example, one can look at the case of al Awlaki, the online preacher of Jihadi terrorism. Al Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric of Yemeni descent, was linked to a series of attacks and plots across the world - from the attacks of September 11, 2001, to the shootings at Fort Hood in November 2009. He has also been linked to the recruitment of a Nigerian terrorist accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on December 25, 2009. Awlaki's overt endorsement of violence as a religious duty in his online sermons and YouTube videos is believed to have inspired new recruits to Islamist militancy. As Kohlmann (2009, 2) concluded, \u201cPerhaps this is the most frustrating aspect of transnational vendors of hate and mayhem like al Awlaki\u201d. The Internet has inadvertently become a powerful tool in their hands, offering easy access to an interactive virtual universe where they can mobilize vulnerable, unstable people around the world and incite them to carry out acts of violence.\u201d Terrorism has changed it face and so has the Internet and its platforms. The Subcommittee on Counterterrorism & Intelligence produced its report on \u201cJihadist Use of Social Media \u2013 How to Prevent Terrorism and Preserve Innovation\u201d (December 2011). The conclusion included the statement: For years, terrorists have communicated online, sharing al Qaeda propaganda or writing in online forums dedicated entirely to the prospect of Islamist terrorism. But they have recently evolved with technological changes, utilizing social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube to enhance their capabilities. In the same places the average person posts photos and communicates with friends and family, our enemies distribute videos praising Osama bin Laden. . . These examples highlight the incredible challenge posed by terrorists engaging online. The Internet was designed to ease communication, and it must stay that way. However, we cannot ignore the reality that we have been unable to effectively prevent jihadi videos and messages from being spread on popular social media websites like YouTube and Facebook.

Terrorists swim in an ocean of bits and bytes. John Arquilla, professor of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School. By its very nature, the Internet is in many ways an ideal arena for activity by terrorist and other extremist groups. The great virtues of the Internet\u2014 its ease of access, lack of regulation, vast potential audiences, fast flow of information, and so forth\u2014have been converted into the advantage of groups committed to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals. The anonymity offered by the Internet is very attractive for modern terrorists. Due to their extremist beliefs and values, terrorists require anonymity to exist and operate in social environments that may not agree with their particular ideological views or their activities. The Internet provides this anonymity in addition to easy, universal access with the options of posting messages, e-mailing, or uploading or downloading information. Once these goals have been accomplished, the internet allows terrorists to disappear into the dark. Terrorists have become increasingly sophisticated at exploiting online platforms for anonymous communications. A simple online e-mail account may be used by terrorists for electronic, or virtual \u201cdead dropping\u201d of communications. This refers to the creation of a draft message, which remains unsent and therefore leaves minimal electronic traces, but which may be accessed from any Internet terminal worldwide by multiple individuals with the relevant password. Emerging technologies were making it easier and cheaper for terrorists to communicate online and increasingly difficult for authorities to monitor these communications. Email, chat rooms, mobile phones, SMS, VoIP, social media, online video sharing, virtual worlds, and micro-blogging sites were not only ideal platforms for terrorists, but they also created enormous volumes of communication flow, thus allowing terrorists to hide among the noise. In addition to the numerous platforms, there was a significant proliferation of alternative devices: conversations, videos, or images could be placed on cell phones, laptop computers, social media, websites, computing tablets, consumer electronics, or gaming devices, many of which can be obtained without providing any subscriber information. There is also an abundance of more sophisticated measures and technologies that increase the difficulty of identifying the originator, recipient, or content of terrorist online communications. These include encryption tools and anonymizing software that are readily available online for download. These advantages have not gone unnoticed by terrorist organizations, no matter what their political orientation. Islamists and Marxists, nationalists and separatists, fundamentalists and extremists, racists, and anarchists all find the Internet alluring. Today, all active terrorist organizations maintain websites, and many maintain more than one website and use several different languages.

First of all, the Internet has become a forum for terrorist groups and individual terrorists to spread their messages of hate and violence and to communicate with one another and with their sympathizers. Secondly, individuals and groups may attack computer networks (bring down airliners, ruin critical infrastructure, destroy the stock market, reveal State secrets, etc.), in what has become known as cyberterrorism or cyberwarfare. At this point, terrorists are using cyberspace mostly for propaganda and communication purposes rather than attacking purposes but as discussed later in this book, cyberterrorism is certainly on the terrorists\u2019 agenda and is likely to become their new mode of operation. Several studies have monitored the various uses of the Net by terrorists (e.g., Weimann, 2002, 2006; UNDOC: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes, 2012). These studies resulted in the identification of numerous - and sometimes overlapping - categories. The various uses of the online platforms by terrorists can be grouped into communicative uses and instrumental uses. The communicative uses include spreading propaganda, launching psychological warfare campaigns, securing inter-communications, and radicalizing recruits (Coll and Glasser 2005, Conway 2002, 2005, Cronin 2006, Glasser and Coll 2005, Labi 2006, Lynch 2006, Rogan 2006, Swartz 2005, Talbot 2005, Thomas 2003, Weimann 2004, 2006a, Vatis 2001). In addition to communicative uses, terrorists use the cyberspace for instrumental purposes that include the teaching and training of terrorists online, and establishing \u201cvirtual training camps\u201d for future assailants (Weimann 2005a, 2006b, 2007, 2008b, 2009d). Let us briefly review the most popular uses of online platforms: Psychological Warfare: Terrorism has often been conceptualized as a form of psychological warfare, and terrorists have certainly sought to wage such a campaign through the Internet. There are several ways for terrorists to do so. For instance, they can use the Internet to spread threats intended to distill fear and helplessness, and to disseminate horrific images of recent actions, such as the brutal murder of the American journalist Daniel Pearl by his captors, a videotape of which was replayed on several terrorist websites. Other means include scary warnings about incoming attacks and threats targeting specific nations, cities, or populations. The Internet, an uncensored medium that carries stories, pictures, threats, or messages regardless of their validity or potential impact-is particularly well suited to allowing even a small group to amplify its message and exaggerate its importance and the threat it poses. Very often this is done by feeding the \u201cconventional\u201d media rather than direct exposure: journalists often cite the threats and declarations taken from online terrorist publications, thus magnifying their impact. Al-Qaeda has consistently claimed on its websites that the 9/11 destruction of the World Trade Center has inflicted psychological damage, as well as concrete damage, on the U.S. economy. The attacks on the Twin Towers are depicted as an assault on the trademark of the U.S. economy, and evidence of their effectiveness is seen in the weakening of the dollar, the decline of the U.S. stock market after 9/11, and the supposed loss of confidence in the U.S. economy both within the United States and abroad. Parallels are drawn with the decline and ultimate demise of the Soviet Union. One of bin Laden\u2019s recent publications, posted on the web, declared that \u201cAmerica is in retreat by the Grace of Almighty and economic attrition is continuing up to today. But it needs further blows. The young men need to seek out the nodes of the American economy and strike the enemy\u2019s nodes.\u201d [5] [5] Propaganda: One of the primary uses of online communication by terrorists is for the dissemination of propaganda (Minei & Matusitz 2011, 2012; Weimann 2006a, 2012a). This generally takes the form of multimedia communications providing ideological, political or religious explanations, justifications, or promotion of terrorist activities. These may include online messages, streaming videos of preaching, social media messages, and even video games developed by terrorist organizations. The Internet has significantly expanded the opportunities for terrorists to garner publicity. Until the advent of the Internet, terrorists\u2019 hopes of winning publicity for their causes and activities depended on attracting the attention of television, radio, or print media networks. These traditional media have \u201cselection thresholds\u201d (multistage processes of editorial selection) that terrorists often cannot reach. No such thresholds, of course, exist on the terrorists\u2019 own websites. The fact that many terrorists now have direct control over the content of their message offers further opportunities to shape how they are perceived by different target audiences, and it allows them to manipulate their own image in addition to that of their enemies. According to the UNDOC 2012 report, \u201cThe fundamental threat posed by terrorist propaganda relates to the manner in which it is used and the intent with which it is disseminated. Terrorist propaganda distributed via the Internet covers a range of objectives and audiences. It may be tailored, inter alia, to targeted audiences that range from potential or actual supporters, to opponents of an organization or shared extremist belief, to direct or indirect victims of acts of terrorism, or to the international community or a subset thereof\u201d (p. 4). Most terrorist online propaganda does not celebrate their violent activities. Instead, regardless of the terrorists\u2019 agendas, motives, and location, terrorist messages emphasize two issues: the restrictions placed on freedom of expression and the plight of comrades who are now political prisoners (Weimann, 2005c). These issues resonate powerfully with their own supporters and are also calculated to elicit sympathy from Western audiences that cherish their freedoms of expression and frown on measures to silence political opposition. Enemy publics, too, may be targets for these complaints insofar as the terrorists, by emphasizing the antidemocratic nature of the steps taken against them, try to create feelings of unease and shame among their foes. The terrorists\u2019 protest at being muzzled, it may be noted, is particularly well suited to the Internet, which for many users is the symbol of free, unfettered, and uncensored communication. Online Indoctrination: The Internet became an instrument for radicalization and indoctrination by modern terrorists. Many of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East were executed by people indoctrinated on the Internet. Recruitment, radicalization and incitement to terrorism should be viewed as points along a continuum. Radicalization refers primarily to the process of indoctrination that often accompanies the transformation of recruits into individuals determined to act with violence based on extremist ideologies. There is a variety of online platforms that terrorist groups use for indoctrinating potential recruits ranging from personal e-mails and online chats to seductive videos and social media. There is also the process labeled as \u201conline self-radicalization.\u201d This is a newer type of terrorist, the homegrown extremist who cultivates his/her views online. The Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013, involved two brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev who used two pressure cooker bombs to kill three people and injure an estimated 264 others. According to FBI interrogators, the Tsarnaev brothers were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs through their exposure to online messages of radical Islam. In recent years, the brothers became interested in Islamic extremism. A video on their YouTube channel, for example, featured a radical cleric, Feiz Mohammad, who lives in Australia. Dzhokhar downloaded a significant amount of jihadist material from the Internet, including a book about \"disbelievers\" with a foreword by radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. In addition, he downloaded Volume One of the Al-Qaeda-produced magazine \"Inspire,\" which offered detailed instructions for building bombs with pressure cookers, shrapnel, and explosive powder from fireworks. Dzhokhar appears to have been largely influenced by his older brother, but he, too, was apparently radicalized online and reportedly confessed in a note that the bombings were meant as retribution for the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Radical Islamic websites often use U.S. military operations in Islamic countries as justification for terrorist violence. Recruitment and Mobilization: The Internet and advanced technology provide powerful tools for recruiting and mobilizing group members, through integrated communications. In addition to seeking converts by using the full panoply of website technologies (audio, digital video, etc.) to enhance the presentation of their message, terrorist organizations capture information about the users who browse their websites. Users who seem most interested in the organization\u2019s cause or well suited to carrying out its work are then contacted. Recruiters may also use more interactive Internet technology to roam online chat rooms, Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms whilst looking for receptive members of the public, particularly young people. The reach of these online outlets provides terrorist organizations and sympathizers with a global pool of potential recruits. The virtual forums offer an open venue for recruits to learn about, and provide support to, terrorist organizations, and they promote engagement in direct actions (Denning 2010, Gerwehr and Daly 2006; Weimann 2007). The global counterterrorism efforts drove many terrorist groups including al-Qaeda to call on their devotees in the West to carry out smaller-scale solo attacks, mainly by providing the online education to teach them how. \u201cI strongly recommend all of the brothers and sisters coming from the West to consider attacking America in its own backyard,\u201d wrote Samir Khan, an American who joined al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemen branch and emerged as a fervent advocate of homegrown, do-it-yourself terrorism before he was killed in an American drone strike in September 2011. In recent years, al-Qaeda propagandists have \u201cmade a particular effort to recruit lonely people who are looking for a cause,\u201d said Jerrold Post, a former C.I.A. psychiatrist now at George Washington University and the author of \u201cThe Mind of the Terrorist.\u201d [6] He points to, among others, Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of shooting 13 people to death at Fort Hood, Tex., in 2009. Major Hasan was held up as an example for others in a two-part video released by al-Qaeda\u2019s core group in Pakistan in June 2011 titled \u201cYou Are Only Responsible for Yourself,\u201d urging Muslims in the West to stage attacks without waiting for orders from abroad. [6] Terrorist recruitment-oriented communication is often tailored to appeal to vulnerable and marginalized groups in society. Very often, this propaganda of recruitment and radicalization capitalizes on an individual\u2019s sentiments of injustice, alienation, or humiliation (European Commission, 2008; Weimann, 2008b). As we will demonstrate later, terrorists became more sophisticated with their usage of \u201cnarrowcasting\u201d, or propaganda that targets specific sub-populations according to demographic factors, such as age or gender, as well as social or economic circumstances (Weimann 2008b, 2008f, 2009b). The cyberspace may be an ideal platform for the recruitment of children and youth who comprise a high proportion of users. Propaganda disseminated via the Internet with the aim of recruiting minors may take the form of cartoons, popular music videos, or computer games. These contents often mix cartoons and children\u2019s stories with messages promoting and glorifying acts of terrorism, such as suicide attacks. Similarly, some terrorist organizations have designed online video games intended to be used as recruitment and training tools. Such games may promote the use of violence, rewarding virtual successes (Weimann 2008b). For example, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is changing its strategy to target children at an early age to lure them to its radical ideology. To do this, beginning March 2013, the group started using new methods deemed to be more capable of attracting children's attention, such as video games that include a clear strategy to show the group's ability to win wars against international forces. On their website AQIM published a computer game: it shows a military aircraft carrying AQIM's black flag while hitting and destroying French aircraft in the Sahara where battles are raging against the terrorists in northern Mali. The website said that the game, \"Muslim Mali\", displays the message \"Congratulations, you have become martyrs!\" in lieu of \"Game Over\" when a player loses all their lives. Data Mining: The internet is a vast source of information on all topics, and is utilized by terrorists to gather any information that may be relevant to their cause or to future operations \u2013 such as satellite images, maps, and blueprints of future targets. In fact, the Net may be viewed as a vast digital library. The World Wide Web alone offers billions of pages of information, much of it free \u2014 and much of it of interest to terrorist organizations. Terrorists, for instance, can learn a wide variety of details about targets from the Net, such as transportation facilities, nuclear power plants, public buildings, airports, ports, and they can even learn about counterterrorism measures. In his book Black Ice: The Invisible Threat of Cyberterrorism (2003, 184), Dan Verton argued that \u201cal-Qaeda cells now operate with the assistance of large databases containing details of potential targets in the U.S. They use the Internet to collect intelligence on those targets, especially critical economic nodes, and modern software enables them to study structural weaknesses in facilities as well as predict the cascading failure effect of attacking certain systems.\u201d According to former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, speaking on January 15, 2003, an al-Qaeda training manual recovered in Afghanistan tells its readers that: \u201cUsing public sources openly and without resorting to illegal means, it is possible to gather at least 80 percent of all information required about the enemy.\u201d In addition to information provided by and about the armed forces, the free availability of information on the Internet about the location and operation of nuclear reactors and related facilities was of particular concern to the authorities after 9/11. Roy Zimmerman, director of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response, said the 9/11 attacks highlighted the need to safeguard sensitive information. In the days immediately after the attacks, the NRC took their Web site entirely off line. When it was restored weeks later, it had been purged of more than 1,000 sensitive documents. The measures taken by the NRC were not exceptional. According to a report produced by OMB Watch, since 9/11, thousands of documents and tremendous amounts of data have been removed from US government sites. [7] When US forces discovered al-Qaeda computers with U.S. dam drawings in Afghanistan, the Army Corps of Engineers stopped posting engineering project designs as a part of contract solicitations. [7] Recently, concern has arisen over the availability of satellite images from Google Earth on the internet. The images, which Google Earth expects to update roughly every 18 months, are a patchwork of aerial and satellite photographs, and their relative sharpness varies. For a brief period, photos of the White House and adjacent buildings that the United States Geological Survey provided to Google Earth showed up with certain details obscured, because the government had decided that showing details like rooftop helicopter landing pads was a security risk. Terrorists do use Google Earth services: detailed Google Earth images of British military bases were found in the homes of Iraqi insurgents, and Hamas terrorists from the Gaza strip use Google Earth to aim their rockets when targeting Israeli towns. The terrorists that attacked various locations in south Mumbai in November 2008 used digital maps from Google Earth to learn their way around. Investigations by the Mumbai police, including the interrogation of one nabbed terrorist, suggest that the terrorists were highly trained, and that they used technologies such as satellite phones and global positioning systems (GPS) linked to Google Earth satellite images. In the planned attempt by terrorists to blow up fuel tanks at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2007, court records indicate that they utilized Google Earth as a means of obtaining detailed aerial photographs of their intended target. [8] The program is seen as superior to maps because it is more up-to-date and gives precise locations for potential targets. [8] Finally, incidents such as the 2011 \u201cWikileaks\u201d disclosures, which unveiled more than 250,000 diplomatic cables, provide government assessments on the state of terrorist organizations, their plans and intentions, and therefore reveal the extent of their knowledge. In August 2013, a leak concerning an al-Qaeda plot to attack US embassies in the Middle East was argued to undermine US intelligence by prompting terrorists to change their methods of communicating. Citing U.S. officials and experts, the New York Times reported on September 29, 2013, that the leaked al-Qaeda plot details in August \u201ccaused more immediate damage to American counterterrorism efforts\" than documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. [9] [9] Virtual training: Some experts have referred to the Internet as a \u201cterrorist university,\u201d a place where terrorists can learn new techniques and skills to make them more effective in their attack methodologies. The continuous attacks on al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and elsewhere have forced the terror group to move its base of operations and training camps into cyberspace. The Internet has become a valuable tool for terrorist organizations, not just for indoctrination, propaganda, and recruitment, but also as virtual training camps for the practical application of terrorism. Thousands of new pages of terrorist manuals, instructions, and rhetoric are published on the Internet every month. \u201cIt is not necessary\u2026for you to join in a military training camp, or travel to another country\u2026you can learn alone, or with other brothers, in [our arms] preparation program,\u201d announced in 2004 al-Qaeda leader Abu Hajir al-Muqrin. Today, as the attacks on al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups intensify, their reliance on the Internet for launching instruction and training campaigns appears to have gone through significant expansion and sophistication. Moreover, the online \u201ccourses\u201d have become more developed and technologically advanced. Online magazines, such as al-Qaeda\u2019s Inspire (and many terrorist websites), also provide training and ideas for terrorist attacks, and the development and widespread availability of the Internet has made it possible to create readily accessible \u201cvirtual training camps\u201d (Amble, 2012; Weimann, 2009d). Documents that are widely available online include the \u201cMujahideen Poisons Handbook,\u201d an instructive manual which contains various \u201crecipes\u201d for homemade poisons and poisonous gases. Similar information on hostage taking, bomb making, and guerilla tactics is also available in a wide variety of other sources such as the \u201cAnarchist Cookbook\u201d and the \u201cSabotage Handbook.\u201d The 600 page \u201cEncyclopedia of Jihad\u201d is also widely available online and includes chapters such as \u201c\u201chow to kill,\u201d \u201cexplosive devices,\u201d \u201cmanufacturing detonators,\u201d and \u201cassassination with mines.\u201d The convenience of access and anonymity that cyberspace provides has done away with the necessity for training in formal training camps for specific tactics being used by the terrorists in many conflict zones. Al-Qaeda\u2019s first online instruction was in the form of a colorful virtual magazine called \u201cAl Battar Training Camp.\u201d \u201cAl Battar\u201d takes its name from the \u201cSword of the Prophets.\u201d In early-2004, al-Qaeda published online the first issue of Al Battar. The introduction to the issue states: Because many of Islam\u2019s young people do not yet know how to bear arms, not to mention use them, and because the agents of the Cross are hobbling the Muslims and preventing them from planning [Jihad] for the sake of Allah \u2013 your brothers the Mujahideen in the Arabian peninsula have decided to publish this booklet to serve the Mujahid brother in his place of isolation, and he will do the exercises and act according to the military knowledge included within it. . . The basic idea is to spread military culture among the youth with the aim of filling the vacuum that the enemies of the religion have been seeking to expand for a long time. Later, this promoted their online training: \u201cOh Mujahid brother, in order to join the great training camps you don't have to travel to other lands. Alone, in your home or with a group of your brothers, you too can begin to execute the training program.\u201d In November 2008, SITE Intelligence Group reported that al-Nusra Media Battalion, a jihadist media group, compiled into a single file a collection of explosives manuals totaling over 1,000-pages, and posted the file on jihadist forums. This collection, entitled, \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Weapons and Explosives, First Part,\u201d includes manuals that are frequently distributed on jihadist forums, such as those written by explosives expert Abdullah Dhu al-Bajadin and distributed by the Islamic Media Center (IMC). These manuals provide instructions for a range of compounds and equipment within this field, including mobile phones for remote detonation, chemical explosives and detonators, and placement of these materials to strike a specific target. The use of new technologies for launching terrorist attacks is a frequent topic discussed in these forums and chat rooms. Thus, videos containing instructions to prepare explosives, optimized for viewing on mobile phones, were posted on the al-Fallujah jihadist forum on October 27, 2008. The videos comprise the explosives series, \u201cLessons in How to Destroy the Cross,\u201d which received much attention by jihadists when it was posted on al-Ekhlaas, an al-Qaeda-affiliated forum. The mobile phone format is a standard by which al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, such as the Islamic State of Iraq, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and as-Sahab distribute their videos. They comprise approximately 19 hours of footage. Fifteen of the lessons focus on particular materials, such as TNT, picric acid, nitro glycol, sodium acid, and ammonium nitrate. The other ten videos involve seminars held on sensitive, semi-sensitive, and non-sensitive substances and detonators, showing an individual leading the course using a whiteboard, illustrations, and various objects. Jihadist forums host discussions on the use of modern online platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others. Finally, the most popular online training manual is the glossy, ultra-modern Inspire magazine. Inspire is an English language online magazine published by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Numerous international and domestic extremists motivated by radical interpretations of Islam have been influenced by the magazine and, in some cases, reportedly used its bomb making instructions in their attempts to carry out attacks. The magazine is an important brand-building tool, not just of AQAP, but of all al-Qaeda branches, franchises and affiliates. The magazine promoted \"open source jihad,\" a necessary tactic as al-Qaeda leadership steadily vanished in the ten years since 9/11. With leaders either dead or in jail, al-Qaeda had to consider new ways to attack its enemies. This caused a shift away from al-Qaeda\u2019s traditional terrorist attacks and a shift towards simple attacks by individuals using common items for weapons. The Summer 2010 issue advised making a pressure cooker bomb using everyday materials (\"How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom\"), a method used by the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers. The 11 th issue of Inspire (published online in June 2013) devoted almost all of its 40-odd pages to glorifying what it calls the \"BBB\" -- the \"Blessed Boston bombings.\" One article, \"Inspired by Inspire,\" is illustrated by a flaming iPad with a copy of the magazine on its screen. In fact, the main takeaway from the issue is that its editors are unabashedly pleased that copies of their magazine were found in the bombers\u2019 (the Tsarnaev brothers) house. th Cyber-planning and Coordination: Not only do terrorists use the Internet to learn how to build bombs, they also use it to plan and coordinate specific attacks. Al-Qaeda operatives relied heavily on the Internet for the planning and coordination of the September 11 attacks. Numerous messages that had been posted in a password-protected area of a website were found by federal officials on the computer of arrested al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Zubaydah, who masterminded the September 11 attacks. To preserve their anonymity, the al-Qaeda terrorists used the Internet in public places and sent messages via public e-mail. Some of the September 11 hijackers communicated using free web-based e-mail accounts. Many more sophisticated methods exist to ensure anonymity online, including the usage of the increasing number of cost-free anonymization services such as the I2P Network and the Tor Project, each of which uses a variety of peer-to-peer and encryption technologies to hide Internet protocol addresses. These anonymization services utilize a proxy server computer that acts as an intermediary and a privacy shield between the client computer and the rest of the Internet. In effect, the proxy acts on the original user\u2019s behalf to protect any personal information from being shared with destination points on the Internet beyond the proxy, and as such, users are able to \u201cspoof\u201d or alter their IP address. These proxy services have increased in sophistication in recent years and now often utilize a peer-to-peer networking approach in order to prevent the user\u2019s identity from remaining in any single central third-party site that could disclose a user\u2019s identity. Hamas activists in the Middle East, for example, use chat rooms to plan operations, and operatives exchange e-mail to coordinate actions across Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Israel. Instructions in the form of maps, photographs, directions, and technical details of how to use explosives are often disguised by means of steganography, which involves hiding messages inside graphic files. Sometimes, however, instructions are delivered concealed in only the simplest of codes. Mohammed Atta\u2019s final message to the other eighteen terrorists who carried out the attacks of 9/11 is reported to have read: \u201cThe semester begins in three more weeks. We\u2019ve obtained 19 confirmations for studies in the faculty of law, the faculty of urban planning, the faculty of fine arts, and the faculty of engineering.\u201d (The reference to the various faculties was apparently the code for the buildings targeted in the attacks.) New and advanced communication technologies are adapted by savvy terrorists for their networking. Two emerging technologies are now used by terrorists: the growing use of mobile computing technologies and the rapid spread of \u201ccloud computing.\u201d Most mobile phones are providing easy access to the Internet and the wide availability of non-registered SIM cards in many countries allows users to make phone calls, send text messages, and surf the Internet without any form of identification required. In addition, the wide availability of cloud computing resources means that terrorists are able to host and store their propaganda material, manuals, and all digital content online with little fear of identification or reprisal. In the 2008 terrorist attack on numerous locations in Mumbai, India, the attackers used all of the most advanced communication technologies. These included handheld GPS devices to plan and perpetrate their attack as well as Google Earth satellite imagery. They received live updates from their handlers on their mobile phones with regard to the location of hostages, especially foreigners. Fundraising : The Internet is probably the simplest, easiest to operate, and least costly method of soliciting donations and contributions. Terrorists use a variety of techniques to raise funds online for their activities. Following a popular business trend, many have turned to e-commerce, selling CDs, DVDs, T-shirts, and books as a means of raising cash. An even easier approach is merely to \u201caccept donations,\u201d and many terrorist organizations have added links to their sites which advise visitors on how to donate funds electronically via bank transfer. Through the Internet, a terrorist group or its supporters can ask for donations to support its actions directly or can, as is often done, disguise its solicitations as support for charity. Many terrorist organizations also create so-called \u201ccharitable organizations\u201d through which they solicit funds promising to use the money to feed and dress the poor, though their true intent is to use the money to fund acts of violence. [10] Several terrorist organizations are already using social networking applications as the latest method for raising money for their activities. Very often the donations are presented as a religious duty and a substitute for joining Jihad as an actual warrior. [10] Almost all groups have used the Internet to solicit donations. Islamist terrorist groups, including Hamas, Lashkar e-Taiba, and Hezbollah have also made extensive use of the Internet to raise and transfer needed funds to support their activities (Jacobson 2010a). Hezbollah used to make direct appeals for donations for the \u201csustenance of the Intifada\u201d on the website of its English language satellite Al-Manar. The website provided details of the bank account to which the donors could send the money. Most of the websites linked to Hezbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and Hamas openly seek donations to support the families of suicide bombers. The website of the Global Jihad Fund asked for donations to be sent to bank accounts in Pakistan \u201cto facilitate the growth of various jihad movements around the world by supplying them with sufficient funds to purchase weapons and train their individuals.\u201d In all these cases, in addition to providing humanitarian aid, such organizations also pursue a covert agenda of providing financial and material support to militant groups. Leaders like Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and others have made a number of appeals for money though online speeches, statements, and videos posted on the Internet. The jihadi leaders often argue that monetary contribution is similar to physically engaging in jihad. The English language website of Harakat ul-Mujahideen (HuM) , a group in Pakistan, stated \u201cAllah gives you the opportunity to take part in the struggle for Muslim rights \u2013 jihad. Even if you cannot take part physically in the jihad, you can help us by the means of financial aid.\u201d Another way that terrorist groups are using the Internet to raise funds is through criminal activity. As a United Nations Report concluded, \u201cThere is substantial evidence that terrorist organizations are using the proceeds from traditional cybercrime, such as online credit card fraud, identity theft and telecommunications fraud to fund their operations\u201d (United Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force 2011, 34). Terrorists also use phishing scams to seduce innocent individuals into providing their credit card details. There are numerous examples of this growing trend. The cell that executed the 2004 Madrid train bombing plot, which killed almost 200 people, partially financed the attack by selling hashish. The terrorists who carried out the July 7, 2005 attacks on the transportation system in London were also self-financed, in part through credit card fraud. The al-Qaeda\u2013affiliated Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) financed the 2002 Bali bombings, in part, through jewelry store robberies. Key terrorist leaders have specifically encouraged their followers to pursue this path (Jacobson 2010b). For example, Imam Samudra, a former JI operative convicted for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings, wrote a book that included a chapter entitled \u201cHacking, Why Not?\u201d In that chapter, Samudra urged other Jihadists to use credit card fraud and money laundering. Samudra even pointed his readers to specific websites that would help individuals get started and to chat rooms where they could find hacking \u201cmentors.\u201d.","title":"Terrorists\u2019 Uses of Cyberspace"},"summary":{"text":" The Internet has become a forum for terrorist groups and individual terrorists to spread their messages of hate and violence. Cyberterrorism is certainly on the terrorists\u2019 agenda and is likely to become their new mode of operation. The various uses of the online platforms by terrorists can be grouped into communicative uses and instrumental uses. Terrorists use the cyberspace for instrumental purposes that include the teaching and training of terrorists online, and establishing \u2018virtual training camps\u201d for future assailants online, among other uses. The use of cyberterrorism has become known as cyberterrorism or cyberwarfare.  Terrorism has often been conceptualized as a form of psychological warfare. Terrorism has certainly sought to wage such a campaign through the Internet. Terrorists can use the Internet to spread threats intended to distill fear and helplessness. Al-Qaeda has consistently claimed on its websites that the 9/11 destruction of the World Trade Center has inflicted psychological damage, as well as concrete damage, on the U.S. economy. The Internet is particularly well suited to allowing even a small group to amplify its message and exaggerate its importance and threat it poses.  One of the primary uses of online communication by terrorists is for the dissemination of propaganda. This generally takes the form of multimedia communications providing ideological, political or religious explanations, justifications, or promotion of terrorist activities. These may include online messages, streaming videos of preaching, social media messages, and even video games developed by terrorist organizations. Terrorist propaganda distributed via the Internet covers a range of objectives and audiences. The fact that many terrorists now have direct control over the content of their message offers further opportunities to shape how they are perceived by different target audiences.  Most terrorist online propaganda does not celebrate their violent activities. Terrorist messages emphasize restrictions placed on freedom of expression and plight of comrades who are now political prisoners. These issues resonate powerfully with their own supporters and are also calculated to elicit sympathy from Western audiences. Enemy publics may be targets for these complaints, by emphasizing the antidemocratic nature of the steps taken against them, try to create feelings of unease and shame among their foes. Recruitment, radicalization and incitement to terrorism should be viewed as points along a continuum.  The Boston Marathon bombing involved two brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who used two pressure cooker bombs to kill three people and injure an estimated 264 others. FBI interrogators say the Tsarnaev brothers were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs through their exposure to online messages of radical Islam. A video on their YouTube channel featured a radical cleric, Feiz Mohammad, who lives in Australia. The brothers became interested in Islamic extremism in recent years, the brothers' YouTube channel, for example, featured a YouTube channel.  Terrorist organizations capture information about the users who browse their websites. Recruiters may also use more interactive Internet technology to roam online chat rooms, Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms. Virtual forums offer an open venue for recruits to learn about, and provide support to, terrorist organizations. The global counterterrorism efforts drove many terrorist groups including al-Qaeda to call on their devotees in the West to carry out smaller-scale solo attacks, mainly by providing the online education to teach them how.  Terrorist recruitment-oriented communication is often tailored to appeal to vulnerable and marginalized groups in society. The cyberspace may be an ideal platform for the recruitment of children and youth who comprise a high proportion of users. Propaganda disseminated via the Internet with the aim of recruiting minors may take the form of cartoons, popular music videos, or computer games. As we will demonstrate later, terrorists became more sophisticated with their usage of \u201cnarrowcasting\u201d, or propaganda that targets specific sub-populations according to demographic factors.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is changing its strategy to target children at an early age to lure them to its radical ideology. The group started using new methods deemed to be more capable of attracting children's attention, such as video games that include a clear strategy to show the group's ability to win wars against international forces. Such games may promote the use of violence, rewarding virtual successes. Terrorists can learn a wide variety of details about targets such as transportation facilities, nuclear power plants, public buildings, airports, ports.  Al-Qaeda cells now operate with the assistance of large databases containing details of potential targets in the U.S. They use the Internet to collect intelligence on those targets, especially critical economic nodes. The free availability of information on the Internet about the location and operation of nuclear reactors and related facilities was of particular concern to the authorities after 9/11.  Terrorists do use Google Earth services: detailed Google Earth images of British military bases were found in the homes of Iraqi insurgents. Terrorists that attacked various locations in south Mumbai in November 2008 used digital maps from Google Earth to learn their way around. In the planned attempt by terrorists to blow up fuel tanks at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2007, court records indicate that they utilized Google Earth as a means of obtaining aerial photographs of their intended target. The program is seen as superior to maps because it is more up-to-date.  Some experts have referred to the Internet as a \u201cterrorist university,\u201d a place where terrorists can learn new techniques and skills to make them more effective in their attack methodologies. The Internet has become a valuable tool for terrorist organizations, not just for indoctrination, propaganda, and recruitment, but also as virtual training camps for the practical application of terrorism. The continuous attacks on al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and elsewhere have forced the terror group to move its base of operations and training camps into cyberspace.  Al-Qaeda's reliance on the Internet for launching instruction and training campaigns appears to have gone through significant expansion and sophistication. The convenience of access and anonymity that cyberspace provides has done away with the necessity for training in formal training camps for specific tactics being used by the terrorists in many conflict zones.  Al-Qaeda\u2019s first online instruction was in the form of a colorful virtual magazine called \u201cAl Battar Training Camp.\u201d In early-2004, al-Qaeda published online the first issue of Al Battar. In November 2008, SITE Intelligence Group reported that al-Nusra Media Battalion, a jihadist media group, compiled into a single file a collection of explosives manuals totaling over 1,000-pages, and posted the file on jihadist forums.  Jihadist forums host discussions on the use of modern online platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others. The use of new technologies for launching terrorist attacks is a frequent topic discussed in these forums and chat rooms. The videos comprise the explosives series, \u201cLessons in How to Destroy the Cross,\u201d which received much attention by jihadists when it was posted on al-Qaeda-affiliated forum al-Ekhlaas. Fifteen of the lessons focus on particular materials, such as TNT, picric acid, nitro glycol, sodium acid, and ammonium nitrate.  The most popular online training manual is the glossy, ultra-modern Inspire magazine. The magazine is an important brand-building tool, not just of AQAP, but of all al-Qaeda branches, franchises and affiliates. The 11 th issue of Inspire devoted almost all of its 40-odd pages to glorifying the \"BBB\" -- the \"Blessed Boston bombings\" One article, \"Inspired by Inspire,\" is illustrated by a flaming iPad with a copy of the magazine on its screen.  Al-Qaeda operatives relied heavily on the Internet for the planning and coordination of the September 11 attacks. To preserve their anonymity, the al-Qaeda terrorists used the Internet in public places and sent messages via public e-mail. Many more sophisticated methods exist to ensure anonymity online, including the use of cost-free anonymization services such as the I2P Network and the Tor Project, each of which uses a variety of peer-to-peer and encryption technologies to hide Internet protocol addresses.  Hamas activists in the Middle East, for example, use chat rooms to plan operations, and operatives exchange e-mail to coordinate actions across Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Israel. Two emerging technologies are now used by terrorists: the growing use of mobile computing technologies and the rapid spread of \u201ccloud computing. The wide availability of cloud computing resources means that terrorists are able to host and store their propaganda material, manuals, and all digital content online with little fear of identification or reprisal.  Terrorists use a variety of techniques to raise funds online for their activities. Many have turned to e-commerce, selling CDs, DVDs, T-shirts, and books as a means of raising cash. Many terrorist organizations also create so-called \u201ccharitable organizations\u201d through which they solicit funds promising to use the money to feed and dress the poor. Several terrorist organizations are already using social networking applications as the latest method for raising money for their\u00a0activities\u00a0for the purposes of raising money.  Most of the websites linked to Hezbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and Hamas openly seek donations to support the families of suicide bombers. Leaders like Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and others have made a number of appeals for money though online speeches, statements, and videos posted on the Internet. The jihadi leaders often argue that monetary contribution is similar to physically engaging in jihad. Another way that terrorist groups are using the Internet to raise funds is through criminal activity.  Terrorists also use phishing scams to seduce innocent individuals into providing their credit card details. The cell that executed the 2004 Madrid train bombing plot, which killed almost 200 people, partially financed the attack by selling hashish.

Key terrorist leaders have specifically encouraged their followers to pursue this path.","title":"Terrorists\u2019 Uses of Cyberspace"}},"3":{"original":{"state":0,"text":"[11]  The Internet has become a major communication channel in the Arab world. In fact, it is the second most important source of information, news, and opinions (see Bunt 2003, 2009). Between 2000 and 2012, Internet connectivity grew by 566 percent worldwide. [12] However, figures for the Middle East show a growth of nearly 2,640 percent, while Internet penetration expanded in Pakistan by a staggering 15,000 percent. [13] Among the earliest attempts by Jihadists to use the Internet was the establishment of Azzam.com in 1997 by a student at the Imperial College in London. Today, most of the terrorist groups on the Net belong to radical Islamist and Jihadi organizations. This should come as no surprise after the publication of several studies and especially the publication of Gary Bunt\u2019s books Virtually Islamic, Islam in the Digital Age , and iMuslims: Rewiring the House of Islam (Bunt 2000, 2003, 2009). Bunt\u2019s research is a detailed description of the diverse manifestations of the Jihadi presence online. He suggests that there has been a significant redirection of resources into the Net by Islamic organizations that adapted to the digital age, preferring the Net over traditional channels of communication. This trend is reflected in the volume of militant Islamic materials online and in the growing sophistication of Islamic Web sites. For example, the presentation of video clips and audio broadcasts on Islamic sites applies some of the most recent developments in computer technology. [12] [13] Bunt argues that \u201cthe Islamic Internet landscape changes frequently, with new sites emerging on a daily basis. Some very proactive players change their content and format regularly, attempting to draw readers to their message(s) in order to establish links or a sense of community\u201d (Bunt 2000, 10). Chat rooms are often unregulated and unmonitored by scholars and clerics, can provide a virtual hangout for teenage and young adult Muslims, and are sometimes rife with anti- kuffar (nonbeliever) sentiment. Bunt concludes, \u201cThe Internet is clearly important in disseminating a broad range of Islamic political-religious opinions and concerns to a global audience. Thus, many extremist Islamist activists and terrorists now see the Internet as a vital tool\u201d (Bunt 2000, 14). According to Bunt\u2019s latest book (2009), the Internet has profoundly shaped how Muslims perceive Islam, and how Islamic societies and networks are evolving and shifting within the twenty-first century. While these electronic interfaces appear new and innovative in terms of how the media is applied, much of their content has a basis in classical Islamic concepts, with a historical resonance that can be traced back to the time of the Prophet Muhammad. One of the most complete reports of the so-called electronic jihad, detailing all the online activities that al Qaeda supporters are encouraged to conduct is the book \u201839 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad\u2019 by Mohammad Bin Ahmad As-S\u0101lim (first appeared online in 2003). [14] Amongst the different activities that can be developed in and through the internet, propaganda (in its various forms) is the most accessible and doable by grassroots activists without any particular technological skill. For example, the author of the \u201939 ways\u2019 suggests militants to register to forums, to post messages strategically in order to keep jihadists topics always at the top of the forum, and to support jihadist views. [14] According to the New America Foundation report \u201cThe State of Global Jihad Online,\u201d the specter of Jihadi online radicalization came dramatically to the fore in 2010, largely because of Jihadi plots linked to American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (Zelin 2013). But the importance of al Qaeda communications long precedes Awlaki. Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden remarked in 2002 that: \u201cIt is obvious that the media war in this century is one of the strongest methods; in fact, its ratio may reach 90% of the total preparation for the battles.\u201d [15] Much of that Jihadi media war now occurs online. Zelin (2013) highlights four different phases in which Jihadi media have been disseminated since 1984: [15]: Phase 1 (Beginning in 1984): Khutbas (sermons), essays/pamphlets, printed magazines, newsletters, and videotaped lectures and/or battle scenes.: Phase 1 (Beginning in 1984): Khutbas (sermons), essays/pamphlets, printed magazines, newsletters, and videotaped lectures and/or battle scenes. Examples: Abdullah Azzam\u2019s tours in Europe and the United States at mosques; a variety of old VHS tapes that came out of Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya; and Jihadi magazines.: Phase 2 (Beginning in the mid-1990s): Top-down websites: These were completely centralized endeavors in which an individual owning a Web domain (often connected directly with Jihadi organizations) held complete monopoly over what content was important and would be distributed.: Phase 2 (Beginning in the mid-1990s): Top-down websites: These were completely centralized endeavors in which an individual owning a Web domain (often connected directly with Jihadi organizations) held complete monopoly over what content was important and would be distributed. Examples: al-Neda and Azzam Publications.: Phase 3 (Beginning in the mid-2000s): Interactive forums: Administrators of the forums help facilitate and disseminate content on behalf of jihadi organizations, but they are not necessarily directly linked. They post important news items and have the power to delete threads and ban users, allowing them to help steer the online community in a certain direction by preventing users from being exposed to particular content or dissent. At the same time, users can play a role in posting a variety of materials, including their own views on events, and have the ability to converse with like-minded individuals across a wide geographic area.: Phase 3 (Beginning in the mid-2000s): Interactive forums: Administrators of the forums help facilitate and disseminate content on behalf of jihadi organizations, but they are not necessarily directly linked.

Examples: al-Hesbah, al-Ikhlas, al-Fallujah, Ansar, and Shamukh.: Phase 4 (Beginning in the late-2000s): Social media platforms. A particular individual is in control of the content. One can post news articles on Twitter and Facebook, create videos on YouTube, and write articles or essays on one\u2019s blog.

Al-Qaeda, the leading force behind most of current Jihadi movements, is today a decentralized network of networks with no structure, hierarchy, and center of gravity. It is based on a global alliance of autonomous groups and organizations, in a loosely-knit international network. This composition is strikingly similar to the Internet with its unstructured network and reliance upon a decentralized web of nodes with no center or hierarchy. The parallel between the two may not be so coincidental: al-Qaeda adopted the Internet and has become increasingly reliant on it for its operations and in order to survive. The war on terrorism destroyed al-Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan and forced the organization to transform into a highly decentralized network of alliances and confederation of affiliates. For the new global network of al-Qaeda, the Internet became a crucial platform, carrier, and bonding mechanism (Weimann, 2008d). The Internet, the most contemporary media outlet, has become the leading instrument of al-Qaeda's communication, propaganda, recruitment, and networking. Al-Qaeda operatives and supporters are operating numerous websites, forums, chatrooms, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and MySpace accounts, with more and more appearing each year.","title":"Virtual Jihad [11]"},"summary":{"text":" Between 2000 and 2012, Internet connectivity grew by 566 percent worldwide.

This was followed in March 2001 by alneda.com, which was active through mid-July 2002. \"Alneda\" means \"The Call\" in Arabic. It was registered in Singapore and appeared on web servers in Malaysia and Texas before it was taken off at the request of U.S. officials. It then changed its name and URL every few days, forced to move from server to server by citizens who complained to the Internet Service Providers (ISP) that were hosting the sites. Then, in July 2002, al Qaeda lost its internet domain: it expired and was acquired by a private citizen. The alneda.com site operators tried to reappear by using various server accounts that had no associated domain name. When that failed, they started posting the alneda.com site as a \"parasite\": the site would be posted on a hijacked website until someone noticed and convinced the ISP to remove it. When it was removed, the process started all over again. In April 2003, al-Qaeda's website reemerged, this time named \"Faroq,\" and it waved the banner of alneda. Although the new site and other al-Qaeda sites moved regularly, various informal means were used to pass on details of the site's new locations, including e-mail correspondence, chat rooms, and announcements or links on other groups' websites. In the summer of 2001, al-Qaeda created a media arm, As-Sahab Media Production Establishment, and released its first video, \u201cThe Destruction of the American Destroyer [USS] Cole.\u201d Several other websites at the time were not directly connected with al-Qaeda, but sympathized with its Jihadi vision. Some such websites include Azzam Publications, At-Tibyan Publications (which had one of the earliest Jihadi-leaning, English-language, interactive forums), and Sawt al-Qawqaz. This top-down phase allowed al-Qaeda to control who produced and disseminated Jihadi materials online. However, the emergence of the Web 2.0 and the growing popularity of interactive forums in the mid-2000s shattered the elitist nature of Jihadi communications. The social media platforms (Blogs, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter) enabled global Jihadists to share news items, original articles and essays, books, videos, and personal accounts. As Zelin notes (2013, 5), \u201cThe newer technologies lowered the bar for participation, making the involvement of low-level or non-jihadis in the online conversation a new feature of the global jihadi movement\u201d. Today, being on the run, al-Qaeda's organization is even more virtual, which means more dependence on the Internet to spread propaganda and plot operations. This reliance on the free access and use of the Internet is also one of the main reasons why, despite the many blows that it has received since 9/11, the organization's operational capabilities have not truly diminished. The Internet is becoming a major weapon in al-Qaeda's bid to win supporters to its cause, preserve its decentralized structure, galvanize its members to action, and raise funds. A widespread network of online platforms is used to feed directions and information from the group's top leadership to supporters and sympathizers around the world and among the Jihadists themselves. Al-Qaeda openly acknowledges the importance of the Internet as a propaganda tool, as it did on one of its numerous websites (the Azzam site): Due to the advances of modern technology, it is easy to spread news, information, articles and other information over the internet. We strongly urge Muslim internet professionals to spread and disseminate news and information about the jihad through e-mail lists, discussion groups and their own websites. If you fail to do this, and our site closes down before you have done this, we may hold you to account before Allah on the Day of Judgment\u2026We expect our website to be opened and closed continuously. Therefore, we urgently recommend any Muslims that are interested in our material to copy all the articles from our site and disseminate them through their own websites, discussion boards and e-mail lists. This is something that any Muslim can participate in, easily, including sisters. This way, even if our sites are closed down, the material will live on with the Grace of Allah. [16] [16] The most visible part of al-Qaeda's online presence involves the spread of propaganda, which is created by the group's media production branch, As-Sahab Foundation for Islamic Media Publication (As-Sahab means \"The Cloud\" in Arabic). This organization uses modern technology to produce its video statements and distribute them to the world, using semi-professional hardware. In addition to being released in Arabic, some published videos include English or other language subtitles, while more recent productions include videos in English and German. Al-Qaeda is also operating radio and television broadcasting online in addition to its online production facility -- the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF), one of al-Qaeda\u2019s mouthpiece groups. In a testimony before the Committee on The Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, United States House of Representatives, Brian Jenkins from the RAND Corporation presented the report entitled \u201cIs Al Qaeda\u2019s Internet Strategy Working\u201d (Jenkins 2011)? [17] He described al-Qaeda as the cutting edge among terrorist groups in cyber knowhow: \u201cWhile almost all terrorist organizations have websites, al Qaeda is the first to fully exploit the Internet. This reflects al Qaeda\u2019s unique characteristics. It regards itself as a global movement and therefore depends on a global communications network to reach its perceived constituents. It sees its mission as not simply creating terror among its foes but awakening the Muslim community. Its leaders view communications as 90 percent of the struggle\u201d (p. 1). According to RAND\u2019s study, Al-Qaeda\u2019s websites fall into three categories: At the top are the official sites that carry messages of the leaders. Recognized jihadist figures discuss issues of strategy on a second tier. The third tier comprises the many chat-rooms and independent websites where sympathizers and followers verbally and visually embellish the official communications, fantasize about ambitious operations, and boast, threaten, and exhort each other to action. According to Jenkins, \"The quantity and easy accessibility of these sites have attracted a host of online jihadists, some of whom are technically savvy and contribute their skills to the overall communications effort\" (p. 2). [17] The unique unstructured and decentralized nature of al-Qaeda affects it online production line, or in fact, production lines : Al-Qaeda is based on numerous branches with the leading ones being al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQIP), al-Qaeda in Iraq, and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Each of these branches has its own media outlet -- for example, in Pakistan, al-Qaeda has As-Sahab Media, in Yemen, Al-Malahim, in Iraq, Al-Furqan, and in North Africa, Al-Andalus. Each of these production lines involves a multi-step process: first, they produce the videos or statements from these organizations or their leaders. Then, they edit the material, inserting sound effects, pictures or video clip, and adding translations or subtitles. Finally, they send the final product(s) off to their media outlets that function as a distribution network online. Very often the administrators of Jihadi forums or social media users will take the content and post it onto online threads and thus promote its exposure. The motive for Al-Qaeda reliance on leading online forums is authentication: By distributing its messages through accredited venues (such as the forums Shamukh al-Islam and al-Fida al-Islam), it assures viewers that the information is truly an official statement. As a result, when the Shamukh al-Islam and al-Fida al-Islam forums went down in March 2012, neither al-Qaeda nor its affiliates distributed any new products. Nothing was officially released from al-Qaeda until Shamukh al-Islam came back. However, within six hours of Shamukh al-Islam being back online, a new release from the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF) had been posted, and within nine hours there was a new release from al-Fajr. Finally, al-Qaeda has undergone a structural shift from being a strictly centralized, hierarchical organization to a huge global network of affiliated, semi-independent cells that have no single commanding hierarchy. The use of the Internet allows these loosely interconnected networks to function, communicate, and maintain their ideological solidarity. The Internet connects not only members of the \"hardcore al-Qaeda,\" but also members of numerous groups who associate themselves with the Jihadist spirit. For instance, the websites of many Jihadist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda are inter-linked, expressing support and solidarity. These sites and their related forums permit terrorists in places such as Chechnya, Palestine, Iraq, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Lebanon, to exchange not only spiritual and religious messages, but also provide online training and practical information about terrorist tactics and practices. Recently, as the RAND\u2019s report highlights, Al-Qaeda has embraced individual Jihad as opposed to organizationally-led Jihad: \u201cIncreasingly, it has emphasized do-it-yourself terrorism. Those inspired by al Qaeda\u2019s message are exhorted to do whatever they can wherever they are. This represents a fundamental shift in strategy. As part of this new strategy, al Qaeda has recognized online Jihadism as a contribution to the jihadist campaign\u201d (Jenkins, 2011, p. 4). This shift is manifested also in the online platforms used by al-Qaeda: there is a steady transition to new channels such as social media platforms that target individuals, emphasize interactivity, and appeal to youth.","title":"Al Qaeda Goes Virtual"},"summary":{"text":" Al Qaeda\u2019s official online debut dates back to February 2000, with the creation of maalemaljihad.com.

A widespread network of online platforms is used to feed directions and information from the group's top leadership to supporters and sympathizers around the world and among the Jihadists themselves.  This organization uses modern technology to produce its video statements and distribute them to the world, using semi-professional hardware. In addition to being released in Arabic, some published videos include English or other language subtitles. Al-Qaeda is also operating radio and television broadcasting online in addition to its online production facility -- the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF), one of al-Qaeda\u2019s mouthpiece groups. Al Qaeda regards itself as a global movement and therefore depends on a global communications network to reach its perceived constituents.  The unique unstructured and decentralized nature of al-Qaeda affects it online production line, or in fact, production lines. Each of these production lines involves a multi-step process: first, they produce the videos or statements from these organizations or their leaders. Then, they edit the material, inserting sound effects, pictures or video clip, and adding translations or subtitles. Finally, they send the final product(s) off to their media outlets that function as a distribution network online.  Al-Qaeda has undergone a structural shift from being a strictly centralized, hierarchical organization to a huge global network of affiliated, semi-independent cells that have no single commanding hierarchy. The use of the Internet allows these loosely interconnected networks to function, communicate, and maintain ideological solidarity. The Internet connects not only members of the \"hardcore al-Qaeda,\" but also members of numerous groups who associate themselves with the Jihadist spirit. For instance, many Jihadist groups affiliated with al Qaeda are inter-linked, expressing support and solidarity.  As part of this new strategy, al Qaeda has recognized online Jihadism as a contribution to the jihadist campaign\u2019 (Jenkins, 2011, p. 4) This shift is manifested also in the online platforms used by al-Qaeda. There is a steady transition to new channels such as social media platforms that target individuals, emphasize interactivity, and appeal to youth.","title":"Al Qaeda Goes Virtual"}},"5":{"original":{"state":0,"text":"In 2003, the prominent al-Qaeda strategist Abu Musab al-Suri posted The Call to Global Islamic Resistance , a massive document outlining a series of suggestions for the future of Jihad. In it, he stressed the need for Al-Qaeda to restructure itself according to the notion of \u201c nizam, la tanzim \u201d or \u201csystem, not organization,\u201d an evolution toward the highly decentralized, multi-nodal network that defines al-Qaeda today. Around the same time, the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was coined, to describe the cyber-enabled, peer-to-peer network shape that the Internet began to take. Among the many manifestations of Web 2.0 was the emergence of new media, a growing array of interactive communications systems facilitated by a rapidly expanding set of platforms. These included Blogs, Web forums, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and YouTube, all linked together in innovative ways that helped begin to form the new media landscape. Amble noted that \u201cThe similarities between these two structural transformations, one of a transnational terrorist group and the other of the Internet, are striking. Indeed, Al Qaeda seems to have acknowledged these similarities by increasingly operating with considerable effectiveness in the new media environment\u201d (Amble 2011, 339). Since the 1990s, Jihadi terrorists have leveraged the power of the Internet in more imaginative ways: almost all Jihadi are active, both publicly and discreetly, on social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram, (Weimann 2010a, 2010b; Weimann and Gorder 2009). As noted by terrorism expert Evan Kohlmann, the trend is clear: \u201cToday, 90% of terrorist activity on the Internet takes place using social networking tools, be it independent bulletin boards, Paltalk, or Yahoo! eGroups. These forums act as a virtual firewall to help safeguard the identities of those who participate; they offer subscribers a chance to make direct contact with terrorist representatives, ask questions, and contribute and help out the cyberjihad.\u201d [18] As new generations have come of age in the Internet era, Jihadi groups (especially those associated with al-Qaeda) have spread their online presence, establishing what terrorism expert Kohlmann described as \u201ca tenacious beachhead in cyberspace\u2026, a cabal of critical Jihadi-oriented online social networking forums\u201d (Kohlmann 2011, 3). As Amble (2011, 339) reports, \u201cTerrorist groups are now harnessing the unique characteristics of the new media environment that has taken shape in the past decade, while security services struggle to conceptualize this rapidly evolving virtual landscape\u201d. [18] Numerous al-Qaeda groups and affiliates are increasingly using social media: The al-Qaeda branch in Yemen has proved especially adept at disseminating teachings and commentary through several different social media networks. The Jabhat al-Nusra, an influential Jihadist group in Syria, tweets mostly in Arabic to its followers, but there are sparing tweets in English clearly trying to appeal to a wide swath of potential recruits and thought leaders from the global community. Groups like Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) have established robust Twitter accounts and social media strategies to push rhetoric and propaganda from North Africa to broader audiences around the world. A 2009 report compiled by the Simon Wiesenthal Center found a number of terrorist-related Facebook groups, including one called \u201cHAMAS Fans\u201d and another titled \u201cSupport Bin-Laden (Al-Qaeda) - Eradicate the West!!!!\u201d (Cooper 2009). Somalia\u2019s Al Qaeda affiliate, Al Shabab, is microblogging to get its message out: \"Our war against the West is a war for the sovereignty and dominance of Allah\u2019s Law above all creation. No to democracy and Kafir laws!\" it tweeted, using the Arabic word for \u201cinfidel\u201d to spread its propaganda. These interactive channels are clearly having some impact on some of the participants. According to the report presented by Kohlmann (2011), each week, new Internet personalities disappear from the web on a mission to live out their outlandish jihadi fantasies. Kohlmann noted that at least 120 such individuals (including U.S. nationals) who have graduated from being mere \u201cpajama-hideen\u201d to taking a real role in terrorist activity over the past seven years. Of these 120 hardcore extremists, more than half were killed. An illustrative example is that of \u201cAnsar al-Mujahideen\u201d user \u201cKhattab 76\u201d who was reported dead on August 23, 2011, after clashes with the Egyptian military in the Sinai Peninsula, where he had gone to \u201cfight the Zionists.\u201d According to Ansar forum administrators, inspired by what he saw on the web, \u201cKhattab 76\u201d had made several previous failed efforts to join al-Qaeda in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Another case involved a participant in al-Qaeda\u2019s \u201cShamukh\u201d forum: On September 18, 2011, moderators on this forum informed their comrades that user \u201cQutaiba\u201d had departed for Algeria to join al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). They quoted a final message from him sent over the Internet: \u201cI am here amongst the mujahideen in the Islamic Maghreb\u2026I advise my beloved ones to join the convoy before it is too late... Your brothers in AQIM are waiting for you.\u201d The most famous individual to self-recruit on the Internet using al-Qaeda\u2019s social networking online was a young Jordanian doctor named Humam al- Balawi (a.k.a. \u201cAbu Dujanah al-Khorasani\u201d). On December 30, 2009, al-Balawi, a former administrator on al-Qaeda forums, blew himself up at a secret CIA base along the Afghan-Pakistani border, killing seven CIA officers and one Jordanian. At the time, CIA intelligence agents believed they had successfully recruited al-Balawi as a double agent to help hunt down Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri and other top Al-Qaida figures. In fact, al-Balawi was offering a starkly different perspective to his associates on the jihadi web forums. In an interview published on Al-Qaida\u2019s \u201cAl-Hesbah\u201d forum in September 2009, only three months previous, al-Balawi appealed, \u201cHow can I encourage people to join the jihad while I\u2019m staying away from it? \u2026How do I become a burning wick for others follow the light of? Can any sane person accept that? Not me.\u201d He also noted the role of al-Qaeda\u2019s social networks: \u201cI left behind on the forums some brothers who are dearer to me than members of my own family\u2026 When I meet any mujahid here who knows about the forums, I rush to ask him who he knows from al-Hesbah\u2014as he might be one of those whom we loved in the cause of Allah, from amongst the administrators or members, and I would hug him as one brother longing for another.\u201d [19] [19] In late 2013, two Palestinian men, one in Gaza and one in east Jerusalem, allegedly conducted Internet conversations for the purpose of planning a series of mega terror attacks. On one end of the chat, in the Gaza Strip, sat a man named Ariv Al-Sham who took his orders directly from the head of al-Qaeda central, Ayman Al-Zawahiri. On the other end was a 23-year-old resident of east Jerusalem, Khalil Abu-Sara. The targets chosen by the two were the Jerusalem Convention Center and the US Embassy in Tel Aviv. The entire communication took place in chats over Skype and Facebook. The two men settled on a plan to bomb both sites simultaneously, and to murder emergency responders in Jerusalem with a follow-up suicide truck bomb. In December 2013 they were arrested and during his questioning, Abu Sara told the Israeli interrogator that his handler in Gaza made it clear to him that he was in direct online communication with Al-Zawahiri. How did the two operatives find each other? According to the investigation, Abu Sara first trawled the Internet, asking Salafi jihadi elements online about where he could get hold of explosives. Abu Sara used the social net to speak to bomb experts from Gaza, learning about the process of assembling explosives. At some point, in the maze of the online jihadi world, he 'met' Al-Sham. What may be most alarming about this phenomenon is the sharp increase in the use of brand name U.S. commercial social networking services such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook by terrorist organizations and their supporters. The emerging trend presents new challenges to counterterrorism officials and experts working to quell and prevent terrorist actions. There is no doubt that YouTube and Facebook have been making genuine efforts in an attempt to thwart the online activities of al-Qaeda supporters and operatives. However, a simple search for Jihadi videos on YouTube will reveal hundreds of al-Qaeda video clips, a compelling demonstration that these efforts have thus far been insufficient in addressing the problem.","title":"Al Qaeda on social media"},"summary":{"text":" In 2003, the prominent al-Qaeda strategist Abu Musab al-Suri posted The Call to Global Islamic Resistance, a massive document outlining a series of suggestions for the future of Jihad.
