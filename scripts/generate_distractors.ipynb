The ever-increasing incidence rate of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis during recent decades, combined with the limited efficacy and potential adverse effects of current treatments, explain the real need for seeking more specific and selective methods for treating these diseases. Aim: To investigate the ability of interleukin 2 (IL2)– caspase 3 chimeric protein, designed to target activated T lymphocytes that express the high-affinity IL2 receptor, to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of acute murine experimental colitis, using a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Methods: Mice with DSS-induced colitis were treated with IL2–caspase 3 for 7 days and disease severity was assessed in parallel to control, non-treated mice, receiving only daily injections of phosphate-buffered saline. IL2– caspase 3 was tested both for its ability to prevent the development of colitis, and for its therapeutic potential to cure on-going, active acute disease. In addition, colon tissue samples were used for myeloperoxidase assays and RNA isolation followed by polymerase chain reaction to determine mRNA expression levels of specific genes. Results: Treatment with IL2–caspase 3 dose-dependently ameliorated the disease activity index (DAI) of mice colitis. We achieved up to 78% improvement in DAI with intravenous injections of 15 mg/mouse/day. Furthermore, IL2–caspase 3 decreased neutrophil and macrophage infiltration to the inflamed tissue by up to 57%. IL2–caspase 3 was proven as a therapeutic reagent in another model, where treatment begins only after disease onset. Here we demonstrated a 70% decrease in DAI when compared to non-treated sick mice. A reduction in mRNA expression levels of both IL1b and tumour necrosis factor a was found in lysates of total colon tissue of treated mice, as compared to sick, untreated mice. We also found that expression levels of Bcl2 were significantly decreased after treatment, while Bax was upregulated in comparison to non-treated mice. Moreover, the Bcl2/Bax ratio, which is elevated in both experimental colitis and in human Crohn’s disease, decreased dramatically after treatment. Conclusions: IL2–caspase 3 chimeric protein may provide a novel approach to the therapy of human IBD, and a possible suggested treatment for other pathological conditions that involve uncontrolled expansion of activated T cells.'],\n",

Activated lymphocytes play a major pathogenic role during disease development. IL2R high-affinity expression between normal and abnormal cells in disease provides the basis for the development of targeted T cell therapies. One immune-mediated disease that can be considered for such targeted therapies is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which comprises primarily two disorders: ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In the United States, an estimated one million people suffer from IBD, with about 30 000 new cases reported each year. IBD is thought to result from inappropriate and ongoing activation of the mucosal immune system driven by the presence of normal luminal flora in the gastrointestinal tract. New emerging strategies and novel approaches have been introduced for the treatment of IBD. The latest therapeutic approaches now being investigated in clinical trials include mainly targets of T cells differentiation, inflammatory pathways, inhibition of adhesion molecules and innate immune stimulation. Chimeric proteins are molecules composed of two proteins fused at the cDNA level. When expressed in a bacterial system, they result in a single polypeptide chain with two moieties: a targeting moiety and a killing moiety. IL2–caspase 3, designed to target activated T lymphocytes, was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinical symptoms of acute murine experimental colitis, using the DSS-induced mouse model. IL2–caspase 3 dose-responsively ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice. Treatment also decreased neutrophil and macrophage infiltration of the inflamed tissue.'],\n",

Patients are still subjected to a very strict diet and lifestyle, especially due to related secondary complications. The need for more specific and selective methods of delivering a drug into specific cells has led to the development of molecules for targeted mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes. IL2–caspase 3, designed to target T lymphocytes expressing the high-affinity IL2R, was tested for its ability to ameliorate clinical symptoms of acute murine experimental colitis. IL2–caspase 3 was chosen to be tested for its effect in a mouse model of DSS-induced colitis. The gastrointestinal tract is home to the largest number of lymphocytes in the body as well as being the site where these cells encounter abundant exogenous stimuli. Following treatment the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, which is elevated in both experimental colitis and in human Crohn’s disease, decreased significantly, following treatment. The Bax ratio was upregulated compared to sick, non-treated mice. Inappropriate T cell responses towards harmless antigens are responsible for the chronic inflammatory processes leading to intestinal inflammation due to T cell accumulation in the inflamed tissue. In 1994, Dialamahn et al reported that mice lacking T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells could still develop colitis in response to DSS. Other studies suggested that lymphocytes are indeed involved in the development of DSS-induced colitis. Kim et al21 investigated the role of lymphocytes in the. development of. the development. IL2- fusion proteins protected from bleeding, shortening and necrosis of the colon. Administration of ONTAK was associated with weight loss and severe lymphopenia, with a balanced (CD4+ and CD8+) loss of,55% of splenocytes. While ONTAk depleted the fractions of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, IL2– caspase 3 spared this subset of cells. DSS-induced colitis is a model that resembles ulcerative colitis, but in its acute form the cytokine profile is Th1 predominant. We found a decrease in mRNA expression levels of both TNFa and IL1b in IL2–caspase 3 treated mice. These findings may explain the amelioration in inflammatory load and thereby the relief in clinical symptoms, according to Gut. Gut: first published as 10.1136/gut.2008.153981 on 31 October 2008. On January 31, 2023 at National Medical Library Ein Kerem. on January 31,. These cytokines are produced mainly by macrophages at the site of inflammation in response to activated Th1 cells. They induce tissue damage by enhancing infiltration of mononuclear cells to the tissue. The gastrointestinal epithelium is a dynamic tissue characterised by a high cellular turnover rate. This unique system is maintained by the balance between intestinal epithelial proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, an interplay already established early in development. The mechanisms of the host’s insensitivity to the normal luminal antigens are only partially understood. The defect in apoptosis in mucosal T cells is an important contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease but not ulcerative colitis. We were interested in determining whether there is a change in the proand anti-apoptotic protein profile in the intact colon, after DSS exposure and following treatment with IL2–caspase 3. We found increased mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 after colitis induction and a significant downregulation to normal basal levels following treatment. Induction of T cell apoptosis is a new biological approach to the treatment of auto-immuno diseases, as well as lymphomas and T cell leukaemias. Several methods have been proposed in order to deplete activated T lymphocytes, such as the use of anti-IL12 monoclonal antibodies. Another new interesting approach is the mechanical removal of leucocytes from patients’ peripheral blood using apheresis, in which to reduce the number of granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes. Infliximab is a chimera (a hybrid consisting of 75% human, 25% mouse protein) monoclonal antibody that was suggested to work by blocking the immune system’s production of TNFa. IL2–caspase 3 may provide the key to restoring the delicate balance of effector T cell expansion during inflammation. We showed that specific depletion of T cells could ameliorate DSS-induced colitis. We also showed that the chimera is non-toxic at therapeutic doses, a least in a mouse model. We suggest that this approach may be applied to many other autoimmune disturbances, as well as other pathological conditions that involve non-controlled activated T cell expansion.'],\n",
