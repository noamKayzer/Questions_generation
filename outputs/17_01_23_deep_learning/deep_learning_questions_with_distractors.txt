TEXT: Machine-learning systems are used to identify objects in images, transcribe speech into text, match news items, posts or products with users’ interests, and select relevant results of search. Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning. Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition. system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor.  Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Deep learning will have many more successes in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage of increases in the amount of available computation and data.  New learning algorithms and architectures that are currently being developed for deep neural networks will only accelerate this progress.

TEXT: Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. In a typical deep-learning system, there may be hundreds of millions of these adjustable weights. To properly adjust the weight vector, the learning algorithm computes a gradient vector that, for each weight, indicates by what amount the error would increase or decrease if the weight were increased by a tiny amount. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech. In practice, most practitioners use a procedure called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) This consists of showing the input vector for a few examples, computing the outputs and the errors, and computing the average gradient for those examples, and adjusting the weights accordingly. The negative gradient vector indicates the direction of steepest descent in this landscape, taking it closer to a minimum, where the output error is low on average. Since the 1960s we have known that linear classifiers can only carve their input space into very simple regions, namely half-spaces separated by a hyperplane19. Problems such as image and speech recognition require the input–output function to be insensitive to irrelevant variations of the input, such as variations in position, orientation or illumination of an object, or variations in the pitch or accent of speech. At the pixel level, images of two Samoyeds in different poses and in different environments may be very different from each other, whereas two images of a Samoyed and a wolf in the same position and on similar backgrounds may be similar to each other. The chain rule of derivatives tells us how two small effects (that of a small change of x on y on y, and that of y on z) are composed. Substituting one equation into the other gives the chain rule.

TEXT: Multilayer networks can be trained by simple Stochastic Gradient Descent. As long as the modules are relatively smooth functions of their inputs and of their internal weights, one can compute gradients using the backpropagation procedure. The idea that this could be done, and that it worked, was discovered independently by several different groups during the 1970s and 1980s. Many applications of deep learning use feedforward neural network architecture (Fig. 1), which learn to map a fixed-size input (for example, an image) to a fixed size output. In the late 1990s, neural nets and backpropagation were largely forsaken by the machine-learning community and ignored by the computer-vision and speech-recognition communities. Recent theoretical and empirical results strongly suggest that local minima are not a serious issue in general in general. The hidden layers can be seen as distorting the input in a non-linear way so that categories become linearly separable by the last layer (Fig. 1), such as hidden layers. Interest in deep feedforward networks was revived around 2006 (refs 31–34) by a group of researchers brought together by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research The analysis seems to show that saddle points with only a few downward curving directions are present in very large numbers. Almost all of these saddle points have very similar values of the objective function. Hence, it does not much matter which of the saddle points the algorithm gets stuck at. Information flows bottom up with lower-level features acting as oriented edge detectors, and a score is computed for each image class in output. In 2009, the approach was used to map short temporal windows of coefficients extracted from a sound wave to a set of probabilities for the various fragments of speech that might be represented by the frame in the centre of the window. It achieved record-breaking results on a standard speech recognition benchmark that used a small vocabulary. By 2012, versions of the deep net from 2009 were being developed by many of the major speech groups and were already being deployed in Android phones. For smaller data sets, unsupervised pre-training helps to prevent overfitting40, leading to significantly better generalization.

TEXT: ConvNets are designed to process data that come in the form of multiple arrays. The architecture of a typical ConvNet is structured as a series of stages. The first few stages are composed of two types of layers: convolutional layers and pooling layers. Units in a ConvNet are organized in feature maps, within which each unit is connected to local patches in the feature maps of the previous layer through a set of weights called a filter bank. The result of this local weighted sum is then passed through a non-linearity such as a Rectified Linear Unit.  Deep neural networks exploit the property that many natural signals are compositional hierarchies. In images, local combinations of edges form motifs, motifs assemble into parts, and parts form objects. Similar hierarchies exist in speech and text from sounds to phones, phonemes, syllables, words and sentences. Backpropagating gradients through a ConvNet is as simple as through a regular deep network, allowing all the weights in all the filter banks to be trained.  Convolutional and pooling layers in ConvNets are inspired by the classic notions of simple cells and complex cells in visual neuroscience43, and the overall architecture is reminiscent of the LGN–V1–V2–V4–IT hierarchy in the visual cortex ventral pathway44. ConvNet models and monkeys are shown the same picture, the activations of high-level units in the ConvNet explains half of the variance of random sets of 160 neurons in the monkey’s inferotemporal cortex.

TEXT: ConvNets have been applied with great success to the detection, segmentation and recognition of objects and regions in images since the early 2000s. A major recent practical success of face recognition is face recognition. Importantly, images can be labelled at the pixel level, which will have applications in technology, including autonomous mobile robots and self-driving cars. Companies such as Mobileye and NVIDIA are using ConvNet-based methods in their upcoming vision-   tems for cars. Other applications gaining importance involve natural language understanding14 and speech recognition7.  Recent ConvNet architectures have 10 to 20 layers of ReLUs, hundreds of millions of weights, and billions of connections between units. ConvNets are easily amenable to efficient hardware implementations in chips or field-programmable gate arrays66,67. A number of companies such as NVIDIA, Mobileye, Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung are developing ConvNet chips to enable real-time vision applications in smartphones, cameras, robots and self-driving cars.

TEXT: Deep-learning theory shows that deep nets have two different exponential advantages over classic learning algorithms that do not use distributed representations21. Both of these advantages arise from the power of composition and depend on the underlying data-generating distribution having an appropriate componential structure40. The hidden layers of a multilayer neural network learn to represent the network’s inputs in a way that makes it easy to predict the target outputs. Figure 3 | From image to text. Captions generated by a Recurrent Neural Network taking, as extra input, the representation extracted by a deep Convolution Neural Network from a test image.  Each word in the context is presented to the network as a one-of-N vector, that is, one component has a value of 1 and the rest are 0. The network learns word vectors that contain many active components each of which can be interpreted as a separate feature of the word. In a language model, the other layers of the network learn to convert the input word vectors into an output word vector for the predicted next word. These word vectors are composed of learned features that were not determined ahead of time by experts, but automatically discovered by the neural network.  In the logic-inspired paradigm, an instance of a symbol is something for which the only property is that it is either identical or non-identical to other symbols. By contrast, neural networks just use big activity vectors, big weight matrices and scalar non-linearities to perform the type of fast ‘intuitive’ inference that underpins effortless commonsense reasoning. Before the introduction of neural language models71, the standard approach to statistical modelling of language did not exploit distributed representations.

TEXT: For tasks that involve sequential inputs, such as speech and language, it is often better to use Recurrent Neural Networks. Backpropagation was first introduced to train RNNs (RNNs) But training them has proved to be problematic because the backpropagated gradients either grow or shrink at each time step, so over many time steps they typically explode or vanish77,78. When we consider the output of the hidden units at different discrete time steps as if they were the outputs of different neurons in a deep multilayer network, it becomes clear how we can apply backPropagation to train Rnns.  This rather naive way of performing machine translation has quickly become competitive with the state-of-the-art. This raises serious doubts about whether understanding a sentence requires anything like the internal symbolic expressions that are manipulated by using inference rules. It is more compatible with the view that everyday reasoning involves many simultaneous analogies of word representations learned for modelling language, non-linearly projected to 2D for visualization using the t-SNE algorithm103. Instead of translating meaning of a French sentence into an English sentence, one can learn to ‘translate’ the meaning of an image.  The encoder is a deep ConvNet that converts pixels into an activity vector in its last hidden layer. The decoder is an Recurrent Neural Network similar to the ones used for machine translation and neural language modelling. Long Short-term Memory networks have subsequently proved to be more effective than conventional RNNs, especially when they have several layers for each time step87, enabling an entire speech recognition system that goes all the way from acoustics to the sequence of characters in the transcription.  LSTM networks or related forms of gated units are also currently used for the encoder and decoder networks that perform so well at machine translation17,72,76. Proposals include the Neural Turing Machine in which the network is augmented by a ‘tape-like’ memory that the RNN can choose to read from or write to88, and memory networks. Memory networks have yielded excellent performance on standard question-answering benchmarks.

TEXT: Human and animal learning is largely unsupervised: we discover the structure of the world by observing it, not by being told the name of every object. We expect much of the future progress in vision to come from systems that are trained end-toend and combine ConvNets with Recurrent Neural Networks that use reinforcement learning to decide where to look. Natural language understanding is another area in which deep learning is poised to make a large impact over the next few years. Ultimately, major progress in artificial intelligence will come about through systems that combine representation learning with complex reasoning.  A Recurrent Neural Network can map an input sequence into an output sequence with elements ot, with each ot depending on all the previous xtʹ (for tʹ ≤ t) The same parameters (matrices U,V,W ) are used at each time step.
