Q1:How do factual knowledge associations emerge in GPT-like transformer models?
Q2:What does this paper investigate?
Best ans: Factual knowledge associations emerge in GPT-like transformer models. We investigate how such associations are stored within GPT models.

Text:Large language models can predict factual statements about the world. For example, given the prefix “The Space Needle is located in the city of,” GPT will reliably predict the true answer: “Seattle” Factual knowledge has been observed to emerge in both autoregressive GPT models and masked BERT models. In this paper, we investigate how such factual associations are stored within GPT-like transformer models.  Our analysis reveals that feedforward MLPs at a range of middle layers are decisive when processing the last token of the subject name. Second, we test this finding in model weights by introducing a Rank-one Model Editing method.

Q1:Inference of factual associations in transformer language models
Q2:What do we find evidence of?
Best ans: The storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models are localized, directly-editable computations.

Text:We analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models, finding evidence that these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations. We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model’s factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feedforward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-one Model Editing. We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task. We also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of difficult counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing.
