(section 3) - (0) What do we analyze? --- The memory of factual associations in transformer language models
 False

(section 3) - (1) What do we analyze in this paper? --- In this paper, we analyze the storage and recall of factual associations and find evidence these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 4) - (0) What does the paper investigate? --- The paper investigates how factual knowledge is stored within gpt-like transformer models.
 False

(section 4) - (1) What method is introduced to test the finding in model weights? --- Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) method for factual knowledge storage
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 5) - (0) What does ROME achieve? --- Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) achieves good generalization and specificity simultaneously. rome is a model editing approach that achieves both generalization, and specification simultaneously.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 6) - (0) Using an autoregressive transformer model, which of these is not true? --- Mlp contributions dominate the early site.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 7) - (0) How do we select p[o]? --- We select  to be 3 times larger than the empirical standard deviation of embeddings. we select p[o] to be three times larger then the empirical normal deviation of embeddedings for the grid of states.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 8) - (0) At what layer did the AIE=8.7% occur? --- Layer 15
 ['23', '8', '7', '9']

--------------------------------------------------
(section 9) - (0) Where does the information accumulate? --- Middle layer of the mlp
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 10) - (0) What type of memory can MLPs be modeled as? --- Associative
 ['syntactic agreement', 'object o', 'generalization', 'the decomposed terms']

--------------------------------------------------
(section 11) - (0) How does the optimization affect the model weights? --- Optimization does not directly alter model weight; it identifies a vector representation v that when output at the targeted mlp module represents the new property for the subject s.
 False

(section 11) - (1) Why can't a convolutional network solve this problem? --- It can only solve the least-squares problem.
 ['an optimization']

(section 11) - (2) What are the steps in selecting the subject? --- Choose inputs that represent the subject at its last token as a key. choose some vector value v√¢ that encodes a new relation (r, o) as property of subject. sample inputs by using g and g(m(l) i:= z)
 False

--------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
(section 13) - (0) What do we report to test generalization-specificity tradeoff? --- Harmonic mean Efficacy Score (ES) Paraphrase Scores (PS) Neighborhood Score (NS) as score (s)
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 14) - (0) What problems did other methods exhibit? --- All tested methods other than Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) exhibit one or both of the following problems: overfitting to the counterfactual statement and failing to generalize, or (f2) underfitting and predicting the same new output for unrelated subjects
 False

(section 14) - (1) What are the layers at which edits generalize best? --- Last subject token is the last subject token. middle layers are the middle layers of the early site identified by 7. Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) demonstrates both generalization and specificity. the final answer: middle layers.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 15) - (0) What problems do FT+L, Knowledge Editor and MEND have? --- Specificity, changing the profession of a totally unrelated subject.
 False

(section 15) - (1) Why is Figure 6 used? --- To compare the generalizations of the gpt-2 xl to the physicist-physician comparisons.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 16) - (0) What do evaluators find about the text generated by ROME? --- The text generated by Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) is somewhat less fluent than models editing using Fine-tuning (FT)+l. the final answer: somewhat less fluent.
 False

(section 16) - (1) How many volunteers were asked to evaluate models? --- Volunteers to assess the quality of generation of text after applying Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) is 15. therefore 15 volunteers evaluate models. the final answer: 15.
 False

(section 16) - (2) How did we evaluate the quality of ROME? --- Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) is a method of text generation that uses a model to generate a sentence. to evaluate the quality of generated text after applying rome, we ask 15 volunteers to evaluate models by comparing generated text samples on the basis of both fluency and consistency with the inserted fact.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 17) - (0) How many facts does Rank-one Model Editing edit at a time? --- One
 ['three', 'two', 'four']

(section 17) - (1) What shed light on factual association within gpt? --- Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) and causal tracing shed light on factual association within gpt.
 False

--------------------------------------------------
(section 18) - (0) What method do we use to measure the causal structure of models? --- We use our causal tracing method to measure the causal structure of models.
 ['Causal', 'the internal computation', 'path-specific effects', 'other modelediting approaches']

--------------------------------------------------
(section 19) - (0) What type of transformers did we study? --- Autoregression transformers
 []

--------------------------------------------------
(section 20) - (0) In what contexts should large language models not be used? --- We stress that large language models should not be used in critical settings. critical settings are situations where people are under extreme stress or danger. the capability to edit large models also has the potential for abuse. therefore the final answer is critical settings
 False

(section 20) - (1) Should large language models be used as an authoritative source of factual knowledge in critical settings? --- The capability to edit large models also has the potential for abuse, such as adding malicious misinformation, bias, or other adversarial data to a model. the capability of editing large models should not be used as an authoritative source of factual knowledge in critical settings. therefore, the final answer is should not.
 False

(section 20) - (2) Which of these is not a reason to edit large models? --- Authoritative source of factual knowledge in critical settings is not a reason to edit large models. therefore, the final answer is authoritative source of facts in critical setting.
 False
