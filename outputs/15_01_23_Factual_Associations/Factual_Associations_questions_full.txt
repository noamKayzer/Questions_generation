Text:Figure 2 plots the Average Indirect Effect of the internal components of GPT-2 XL (1.5B parameters) The Average Total Effect of this experiment is 18.6%, and we note that a large portion of the effect is mediated by strongly causal individual states (AIE=8.7% at layer 15) at the last subject token. The presence of strong causal states at a late site immediately before the prediction is unsurprising, but their emergence at an early site is a new discovery. Decomposing the causal effects suggests a decisive role for MLP modules at the early site.

Causal Tracing is more informative than gradient-based salience methods such as integrated gradients.

Text:The grid of states (Figure 1) forms a causal graph (Pearl, 2009) describing dependencies between the hidden variables. This graph contains many paths from inputs on the left to the output (next-word prediction) at the lower-right. We wish to understand if there are specific hidden state variables that are more important than others when recalling a fact. As Vig et al. (2020b) have shown, this is a natural case for causal mediation analysis.  G is allowed to continue normally, giving us a set of corrupted activations. Because G loses some information about the subject, it will likely return an incorrect answer. The corrupted-with-restoration run, lets G run computations on the noisy embeddings as in the corrupted baseline. The ability of a few clean states to recover the correct fact, despite many other states being corrupted by the obfuscated subject, will indicate their causal importance in the computation graph. The Total Effect (TE) is the difference between these quantities: TE = P[o] − P∗[o].  The Indirect Effect (IE) of a specific mediating state h(l) i is defined as the difference between the probability of o under the corrupted version and the probability when that state is set to its clean version, while the subject remains corrupted.

Best ans: A linear associative memory is a type of memory that can recall facts in a linear fashion. geva et al. (2021) observed that mlp layers can act as two-layer key–value memories. therefore, the final answer is linear as associationative memory.

Text:The grid of states (Figure 1) forms a causal graph (Pearl, 2009) describing dependencies between the hidden variables. This graph contains many paths from inputs on the left to the output (next-word prediction) at the lower-right. We wish to understand if there are specific hidden state variables that are more important than others when recalling a fact. As Vig et al. (2020b) have shown, this is a natural case for causal mediation analysis.  G is allowed to continue normally, giving us a set of corrupted activations. Because G loses some information about the subject, it will likely return an incorrect answer. The corrupted-with-restoration run, lets G run computations on the noisy embeddings as in the corrupted baseline. The ability of a few clean states to recover the correct fact, despite many other states being corrupted by the obfuscated subject, will indicate their causal importance in the computation graph. The Total Effect (TE) is the difference between these quantities: TE = P[o] − P∗[o].  The Indirect Effect (IE) of a specific mediating state h(l) i is defined as the difference between the probability of o under the corrupted version and the probability when that state is set to its clean version, while the subject remains corrupted. Our methods also apply to GPT variants such as Wang & Komatsuzaki (2021) that put attention in parallel to the MLP.

Q1:In this paper, we propose a method for selecting the subject and a vector representation for the subject.
Q2:What is the closed form solution?
Best ans: The method is based on the moore-penrose pseudoinverse: w = v k+. the method can be used to solve the problem of insertion of a new key–value pair (k, v) in a fully-connected layer.
['A0: Eqn.4 is an optimization algorithm that solves for the moore-penrose pseudoinverse: w = v k+.', 'A1: We use the moore-penrose pseudoinverse to solve the problem of insertion of a new key–value pair (k, v) into the memory. we use a fully-connected layer to solve this problem.', 'A2: The method is based on the moore-penrose pseudoinverse: w = v k+. the method can be used to solve the problem of insertion of a new key–value pair (k, v) in a fully-connected layer.', 'A3: This paper proposes a method for selecting the subject and a vector representation for the subject.', 'A4: Selecting subject and vector representation for subjects', 'A5: Selecting subject and vector representation for subject', 'A6: This work introduces a method for selecting the subject and a vector representation for the subject.', 'A7: A method for selecting the subject and a vector representation for the subject.']
Text:A new key–value pair (k∗, v∗) can be inserted optimally into the memory by solving a constrained least-squares problem. In a convolutional network, Bau et al. solve this using an optimization, but in a fully-connected layer, we can derive a closed form solution: minimize ∥ ˆWK − V. The solution is based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse: W = V K+.  Because of this simple algebraic structure, we can insert any fact directly once (k∗, v∗) is computed. Step 1: Choosing k∗ to Select the Subject, we choose inputs that represent the subject at its last token as the lookup key. Step 2: We choose some vector value vâ� that encodes the new relation (r, o∗), as a property of s. Step 3: We sample xj by generating 50 random token sequences of length 2 to 10 using G.  Eqn.4a seeks a vector z that, when substituted as the output of the MLP at the token i at the end of the subject (notated G(m(l∗) i := z), will cause the network to predict the target object o∗ in response to the factual prompt p′ (of the form “{subject} is a”) The optimization does not directly alter model weights; it identifies a vector representation v∗ that when output at the targeted MLP module, represents the new property for the subject s.

Q1:Why do we use causal tracing?
Q2:What is the modification of the causal effects?
Best ans: This modification is a way of probing path-specific effects for paths that avoid mlp computations.

Text:Figure 2 plots the Average Indirect Effect of the internal components of GPT-2 XL (1.5B parameters) The Average Total Effect of this experiment is 18.6%, and we note that a large portion of the effect is mediated by strongly causal individual states (AIE=8.7% at layer 15) at the last subject token. The presence of strong causal states at a late site immediately before the prediction is unsurprising, but their emergence at an early site is a new discovery. Decomposing the causal effects suggests a decisive role for MLP modules at the early site.  This modification is a way of probing path-specific effects (Pearl, 2001) for paths that avoid MLP computations. Causal Tracing is more informative than gradient-based salience methods such as integrated gradients. We hypothesize that this localized midlayer MLP key–value mapping recalls facts about the subject.
