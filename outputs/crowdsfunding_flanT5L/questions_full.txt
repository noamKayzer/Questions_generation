Q1:How do we measure the effectiveness of a model for crowdfunding?
Q2:How do we measure effectiveness of a model for crowdfunding?
Best ans: To measure effectiveness of a model for crowdfunding, we use F-Score accuracy to evaluate the model.
['A0: Using F-score as a measurement, this study investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzword.', 'A1: To measure effectiveness of a model for crowdfunding, we use F-Score accuracy to evaluate the model.', 'A2: We used the F-score method to measure the effectiveness of a model.', 'A3: F-score accuracy is a measure used to evaluate the effectiveness of a model.

Text:Study aims to examine whether the set of features we use for prediction and the dataset on which learning was applied deliver a better model by means of F-score accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the relationship between funding success and buzzwords. We show that buzzwords feature is among the features that are highly correlated to funding success compared to both the parameters that we examined and that other researchers examined. From a practical perspective, the results of our study are highly relevant to fundraisers using crowdfunding web platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. We developed a novel model based on semantic features only and achieved similar accu racy level as previous studies.

Text:Orel Babayoff: We present a novel model for predicting the success of crowdfunding projects in meeting their funding goals. Our model focuses on semantic features only, whose performance is comparable to that of previous models. In an additional model we developed, we examine both project metadata and project semantics. We analyze a large dataset of crowdfunding project data, larger than reportec in the art.

Q1:In which method is the topic of the text model?
Q2:What is a widely used topic modeling method?
Best ans: The topic of the text model is Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) 
['A0: The topic of the text model is Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)  The final answer: Latent.', 'A1: In Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)  each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics.', 'A2: The topic of the text model is Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) ', 'A3:  Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)is a widely used topic modeling method.', 'A4: subject model', 'A5:  Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)algorithm', 'A6: topic modeling', 'A7: LDA']
Text: Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)is a widely used topic modeling method. LDA algorithm considers each document as a collection of topics, where each word in the document belongs to one or some of these topics. The three main inputs to the LDA topic model are the dictionary, the corpus, and the number of topics. In our study, we used LDA to extract features from project descriptions where each topic is a feature. The percentage contribution of a topic was the value of the feature that represented that topic.

Q1:Why do crowdfunding projects have a high funding success rate?
Q2:What does this study show about the use of semantics?
Best ans: Unlike prior studies, we use unique features (for example, the use of buzzwords) and perform extensive research on. the semantics of the projects’ text. We use semantic features extracted from the. text to build a predictive model of funding success. We show that the introduction of semantics into. funding success prediction indeed improves accuracy, thus justifying our method

Q1:Do crowdfunding projects achieve their goals on Kickstarter?
Q2:What do we do after the model is validated?
Best ans: Using the success rate of Kickstarter as a baseline, we build a model of funding success using the textual features extracted from the projects’ text to predict funding success. We use the results of previous studies to validate our model and provide recommendations for improving project funding success chances. We also provide recommendations on how to increase project funding successes.
