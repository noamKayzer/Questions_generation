Q:Where does the information accumulate?
A:Middle layer of the mlp
--------------------------------------------------
Q:What type of memory can MLPs be modeled as?
A:Associative
--------------------------------------------------
Q:How does the optimization affect the model weights?
A:Optimization does not directly alter model weight; it identifies a vector representation v that when output at the targeted mlp module represents the new property for the subject s.
Q:Why can't a convolutional network solve this problem?
A:It can only solve the least-squares problem.
Q:What are the steps in selecting the subject?
A:Choose inputs that represent the subject at its last token as a key. choose some vector value v√¢ that encodes a new relation (r, o) as property of subject. sample inputs by using g and g(m(l) i:= z)
Q:How does Bau solve the constrained least-squares problem?
A:We solve the constrained least-squares problem using a fully connected layer. we use the moore-penrose pseudoinverse to solve the problem.
