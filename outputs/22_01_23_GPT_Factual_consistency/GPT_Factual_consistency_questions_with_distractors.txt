TEXT: We analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models, finding evidence that these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations. We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model’s factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feedforward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-one Model Editing. We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task. We also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of difficult counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset, visualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available at https://rome.baulab.info/.

TEXT: Large language models can predict factual statements about the world. For example, given the prefix “The Space Needle is located in the city of,” GPT will reliably predict the true answer: “Seattle” Factual knowledge has been observed to emerge in both autoregressive GPT models and masked BERT models. In this paper, we investigate how such factual associations are stored within GPT-like transformer models.  Our analysis reveals that feedforward MLPs at a range of middle layers are decisive when processing the last token of the subject name. Second, we test this finding in model weights by introducing a Rank-one Model Editing method.

section 5 - (1) What does this paper investigate? --- Factual knowledge associations emerge in GPT-like transformer models. We investigate how such associations are stored within GPT models.

section 5 - (2) What method do we introduce to test the finding in model weights? --- In this paper, we introduce the Rank-one Model Editing (ROME) method for obtaining factual knowledge from large language model weights.

TEXT: The grid of states (Figure 1) forms a causal graph (Pearl, 2009) describing dependencies between the hidden variables. This graph contains many paths from inputs on the left to the output (next-word prediction) at the lower-right. We wish to understand if there are specific hidden state variables that are more important than others when recalling a fact. As Vig et al. (2020b) have shown, this is a natural case for causal mediation analysis.  G is allowed to continue normally, giving us a set of corrupted activations. Because G loses some information about the subject, it will likely return an incorrect answer. The corrupted-with-restoration run, lets G run computations on the noisy embeddings as in the corrupted baseline. The ability of a few clean states to recover the correct fact, despite many other states being corrupted by the obfuscated subject, will indicate their causal importance in the computation graph. The Total Effect is the difference between these quantities: TE = P[o] − P∗[o].  The Indirect Effect of a specific mediating state h(l) i is defined as the difference between the probability of o under the corrupted version and the probability when that state is set to its clean version, while the subject remains corrupted. Our methods also apply to GPT variants such as Wang & Komatsuzaki (2021) that put attention in parallel to the MLP. We select ν to be 3 times larger than the empirical standard deviation of embeddings.

section 8 - (2) How do we select IE? --- The Total Effect (TE) of a state is the difference between the probability of o under the corrupted version and the probability when that state is set to its clean version. The Indirect Effect (IE) of h(l) i is defined as the difference in the probability that o when that states is set in parallel to the MLP. We select  to be 3 times larger than the empirical standard deviation of embeddings.

TEXT: Figure 2 plots the Average Indirect Effect of the internal components of GPT-2 XL (1.5B parameters) The Average Total Effect of this experiment is 18.6%, and we note that a large portion of the effect is mediated by strongly causal individual states (AIE=8.7% at layer 15) at the last subject token. The presence of strong causal states at a late site immediately before the prediction is unsurprising, but their emergence at an early site is a new discovery. Decomposing the causal effects suggests a decisive role for MLP modules at the early site.  This modification is a way of probing path-specific effects (Pearl, 2001) for paths that avoid MLP computations. Causal Tracing is more informative than gradient-based salience methods such as integrated gradients. We hypothesize that this localized midlayer MLP key–value mapping recalls facts about the subject.

TEXT: Based on causal traces, we posit a specific mechanism for storage of factual associations. Each midlayer MLP module accepts inputs that encode a subject, then produces outputs that recall memorized properties about that subject. Middle layer MLP outputs accumulate information, then the summed information is copied to the last token by attention at high layers. This hypothesis localizes factual association along three dimensions, placing it (i) in the MLP modules (ii) at specific middle layers (iii) and specifically at the processing of the subject’s last token.  (e) To write new value vector v∗ into the layer, (f) we calculate a rank-one update to cause ˆ W (l) projk∗ = v, while minimizing interference with other memories stored in the layer. could be equivalently stored in any one of the middle MLP layers.

TEXT: A new key–value pair (k∗, v∗) can be inserted optimally into the memory by solving a constrained least-squares problem. In a convolutional network, Bau et al. solve this using an optimization, but in a fully-connected layer, we can derive a closed form solution: minimize ∥ ˆWK − V. The solution is based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse: W = V K+.  Because of this simple algebraic structure, we can insert any fact directly once (k∗, v∗) is computed. Step 1: Choosing k∗ to Select the Subject, we choose inputs that represent the subject at its last token as the lookup key. Step 2: We choose some vector value vâ� that encodes the new relation (r, o∗), as a property of s. Step 3: We sample xj by generating 50 random token sequences of length 2 to 10 using G.  Eqn.4a seeks a vector z that, when substituted as the output of the MLP at the token i at the end of the subject (notated G(m(l∗) i := z), will cause the network to predict the target object o∗ in response to the factual prompt p′ (of the form “{subject} is a”) The optimization does not directly alter model weights; it identifies a vector representation v∗ that when output at the targeted MLP module, represents the new property for the subject s.

section 12 - (1) How does the optimization affect the model weights? --- Optimization does not directly alter model weights; it identifies a vector representation v that when output at the targeted MLP module, represents the new property for the subject s.

TEXT: We evaluate Rank-one Model Editing on the Zero-Shot Re-  Table 1: zsRE Editing Results on GPT-2 XL. lation Extraction (zsRE) task. Our evaluation slice contains 10,000 records, each containing one factual statement, its paraphrase, and one unrelated fact. “Efficacy” and “Paraphrase” measure post-edit accuracy I o∗ = argmaxoPG′ [o], while “Specificity” measures the edited model’s accuracy on an unrelated fact.  ROME is competitive with hypernetworks and Fine-tuning methods despite its simplicity. We find that it is not hard for ROME to insert an association that can be regurgitated by the model. Robustness under paraphrase is also strong, although it comes short of custom-tuned hyperparameter networks Knowledge Editor-zsRE and MEND-ZsRE.

To test generalization–specificity tradeoff, we report the harmonic mean of Efficacy Score, PS, Neighborhood Score as Score (S) We also wish to measure semantic consistency of G′’s generations.

It contains 21,919 records with a diverse set of subjects, relations, and linguistic variations. The goal is to differentiate robust storage of new facts from the superficial regurgitation of target words. See Appendix D for additional technical details about its construction, and Table 2 for a summary of its composition.

TEXT: In Section 2, we used Causal Tracing to identify decisive hidden states. To confirm that factual associations are stored in the MLP modules that output those states, we test Rank-one Model Editing’s effectiveness when targeted at various layers and tokens. Figure 5 plots four metrics evaluating both generalization and specificity. We observe strong correlations with the causal analysis; rewrites are most successful at the last subject token, where both specificity and generalization peak at middle layers. The layers at which edits generalize best correspond to the middle layers of the early site identified by 7.  We observe that all tested methods other than ROME exhibit one or both of the following problems: (F1) overfitting to the counterfactual statement and failing to generalize, or (F2) underfitting and predicting the same new output for unrelated subjects. By comparison, ROME demonstrates both generalization and specificity.

TEXT: The question of what a model learns is a fundamental problem that has been approached from several directions. Causal effects have been used to probe important information within a network in a way that avoids misleading spurious correlations. The Causal Tracing method introduces paired interventions that allow explicit measurement of causal IEs of individual hidden state vectors. Another line of work aims to assess the knowledge within LMs by evaluating whether the model predicts pieces of knowledge. We use our Causal tracing method to measure the causal structure of models.  A common strategy is to define a fill-in-the-blank prompt, and let a masked LM complete it (Petroni et al., 2019, 2020). Later work showed that knowledge extraction can be improved by diversifying the prompts. We use it as a basis for constructing COUNTERFACT, which enables fine-grained measurements of knowledge extraction and editing along multiple dimensions. Different from prior work, we do not strive to extract the most knowledge from a model, but rather wish to understand mechanisms of knowledge recall.  Mitchell et al. (2021) presents a hyper-network method that learns to transform the decomposed terms of the gradient in order to efficiently predict a knowledge update. We compare with all these methods in our experiments, and find that our single-layer Rank-one Model Editing parameter intervention has comparable capabilities.

section 21 - (2) In what contexts should large language models not be used? --- We stress that large language models should not be used in critical settings. Critical settings are situations where people are under extreme stress or danger. The capability to edit large models also has the potential for abuse. Therefore, the final answer is critical settings such as schools.
 ['We describe some experiments demonstrating when the knowledge of fact detection algorithms is useful enough as to warrant employing pre-neural AI solutions instead', 'We are interested particularly here to examine how facts interact between entities across multiple layers of an LMs output using a new model, Fin', 'We have two points that can make using text classification tools, especially trained LMs like GPT-2 challenging for NLP researchers when', 'We have argued for several arguments against our argumentation that claim model behavior varies over time which we think is likely to explain a lack', 'We argue against such use because it harms performance while at the same time exposing vulnerabilities when using them online-with examples including a']
section 21 - (3) Which of these is not a reason to edit large models? --- Authoritative source of factual knowledge in critical settings is not a reason to edit large models. Therefore, the final answer is authoritative source of facts in critical setting.
 ['Authoritative References about this particular point are provided with reference below at Table3   -Factoring Knowledge Distilling from Prefact', 'Authoritative fact check papers, however often ignore evidence beyond what can be provided from source-domain examples used by GTs trained specifically on', 'Authoritative facts will certainly impact our future scientific achievements as it helps us make better science-aware decisions from data generated with the aim being', 'Authoritative article should use all the information, i want only an answer so that we can understand which things matter when they say how does', 'Authoritative Wikipedia articles are very well-editble as comparedto fact checking sources like FEVER that claim claims from news agencies,']
section 21 - (4) How is the information in a large language model derived? --- This information is derived from the model's knowledge of the language.
 ['This information is derived from models of the language.', 'This information is derived from a model’s stored factual association of the language.', 'This information is derived from internal model representations of the language.', 'This information is derived from an accurate understanding of the language.']
