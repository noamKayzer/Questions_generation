Q:What is the key aspect of deep learning??
A:These layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Therefore, the final answer is these layers of layers are notdesigned by human.

Q:What is the difference between deep learning and regular learning??
A:Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Therefore, the final answer is Deep learning....
Q:In deep learning, what is the process for adjusting the weights?
A:In deep learning, the weights are adjusted by the learning algorithm. To properly adjust weights, the learning algorithms computes a gradient vector that indicates by what amount an error would increase or decrease if the weight were increased by a tiny amount. Therefore, the final answer is stochastic gradient descent ( stochastic gradient descent (SGD) ) This..
Q:Why are non-linear functions used in neural networks?
A:Input–output function to be insensitive to irrelevant variations of the input. Therefore, the final answer is to be sensitive to minute details — distinguishing Samoyeds from white wolves — and insensitive To large irrelevant variations.

Q:How can one train a multilayer network? ___
A:By simple stochastic gradient descent. Therefore, the final answer is simple stochaastic gradient descend.. Using the backpropagation procedure.
--------------------------------------------------
Q:What are the two types of layers in a ConvNet?
A:Convolutional layers and pooling layers. Therefore, the final answer is convolutional and pooled layers..
--------------------------------------------------
Q:What are ConvNets used for???
A:Detection, segmentation and recognition of objects and regions in images. Therefore, the final answer is the detection, Segmentation  and recognition. of objects.
--------------------------------------------------
Q:Why are neural networks better than classic learning algorithms? Why?
A:The hidden layers of a multilayer neural network learn to represent the network’s inputs in a way that makes it easy to predict the target outputs. Therefore, the final answer is learn to present the network's input in  away that makes It easy to anticipate the target.

Q:How can we train recurrent neural networks??
A:To answer the question, consider the following: Backpropagation was first introduced to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) But training them has proved to be problematic because the backpropagated gradients either grow or shrink at each time step, so over many time steps they typically explode or vanish77,78. When we consider the output of the hidden units at different discrete time steps as if they were the outputs of different neurons in a deep multilayer network, it becomes clear how we can apply backPropagation to train RNns.

Q:How do humans and animals learn??
A:Human and animal learning is largely unsupervised. Therefore, the final answer is observing it..
