Q:What is the average?
A:The expected value of a random variable is the weighted sum of all possible values of x weighte d by their probabilities. The probabilities have to sum to 1. They're positive numbers, or zero. They reflect the likelihood of that random variable occurring, of that value of the random variable. If you have n observations on a randomly chosen random variable, you can take the sum of the x observations, summation over 1 to n, and then divide that by n. This is an estimate of the expected value.
Q:What is the most basic concept in finance?
A:The most basic concept in finance is the return to investing in something. The return to investment is the increase in the price.

Q:What is the standard deviation?
A:square root of the variance
Q:What is covariance?
A:A measure of how two different random variables move together. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
Q:What does the speaker recommend?
A:Gross return is a measure of the outcome of the investments. The speaker recommends using gross return in evaluating investments.

Q:What is the core idea of the universe?
