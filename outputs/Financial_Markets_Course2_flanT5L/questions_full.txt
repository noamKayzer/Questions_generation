Q1:The speaker is going to talk about what in the context?
Q2:What is the one way people think about a crisis like this?
Best ans: Probability models
['A0: Financial crisis', 'A1: Probability models', "A2: A financial crisis that's bigger than any since the Great Depression of the 1930's", "A3: Financial crisis that's bigger than any since the Great Depression of the 1930's.", 'A4: breakdowns', 'A5: probabilistic risk models', 'A6: probability models and systematic risk', 'A7: financial theory']
Text: The crisis began with bubbles in the stock market, housing market, and also in the commodities market. It's a financial crisis that's bigger than any since the Great Depression of the 1930's. There's many different ways of thinking about a crisis like this. And I wanted to focus on one way that people think about it in terms of probability models. So, that's not the only way, it's not necessarily my favorite way. Excuse my cold. I didn't bring any water. I hope I make it through this lecture.  There was a pre-break around 2000 when the stock market collapsed around the world. But then they came back again after 2003 and they were on another boom, like a roller coaster ride. That's the narrative story. And then, what happened is, we see a bunch of institutional collapses. We saw bank failures in the U.S. and then, we saw international cooperation to prevent this from spreading like a disease. So, we had governments all over the world bailing out their banks and other companies. That's what financial theorists will think about is that actually it's not just those few big events. It's the accumulation of a lot of little events.  I'm going to talk today about probability, variance, and covariance, and regression, and idiosyncratic risk, and systematic risk. But I'm also going to, in the context of the crisis, emphasize in this lecture, breakdowns of some of the most popular assumptions that underlie financial theory. And I'm thinking particularly of two breakdowns. One is the failure of independence. And another one is a tendency for outliers or fat-tailed distributions.

Q1:When you invest in something, what is the increase in the price?
Q2:What is the return to investing in something?
Best ans: The return to investing in something is the increase in the price.
['A0: p t plus 1, or pt.', 'A1: This is the return to investing in something.', "A2: When you invest in something for a time interval, what is your return to investing in something? It's your return.", 'A3: The return to investing in something is the increase in the price.', 'A4: your returns', 'A5: Return', 'A6: returns', 'A7: return']
Text:In finance, the basic, the most basic concept that -- in finance -- is that when you invest in something, you have to do it for a time interval. And so, what is your return to investing in something? It's the increase in the price. That's p t plus 1, minus p t. Returns can be positive or negative. They can never be more than -- never be less than minus 100%. In a limited liability economy that we live in, the law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put in. This is the mathematical expectation of a random variable x, which could be the return, or the gross return, but we're going to substitute something else. The expectation of x is the weighted sum of all possible values of x weighted by their probabilities. And the probabilities have to sum to 1. They're positive numbers, or zero, reflecting the likelihood of that random variable occurring, of that value of the random variable. This is for a discrete random variable that takes on only a finite, only a countable number of values. Gross return is always positive. It's between zero and infinity. If you have n observations on a random variable x, you can take the sum of the x observations, summation over i equals 1 to n, and then divide that by n. That's called the average, or the mean, or sample mean, when you have a sample of n observations, which is an estimate of the expected value of x. This is called the mean or average, which you've learned long ago, OK. So, for example, if we're evaluating an investor who has invested money, you could get n observations and take an average of them. The geometric mean makes sense only when all the x's are non-negative. If you put in a negative value, you might get a negative product, and then, if you took the nth root of that, it could be an imaginary number, so let's forget that. We're not going to apply this formula if there are any negative numbers.

Q1:Why can't you lose more than you put into an investment in finance?
Q2:What is the law of limited liability?
Best ans: This is the law of limited liability. The law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put in.
["A0: You can't lose more than you put into an investment. The law says you can''t.", 'A1: This is the law of limited liability.', "A2: You can't lose more than you put into an investment.", 'A3: This is the law of limited liability. The law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put in.', 'A4: the Law', 'A5: Law', 'A6: limited liability economy in which we live', 'A7: Law in limited liability economy']

(3) RQUGE:4.9123
Q1:Which of these is not a measure of covariance?
Q2:What is the standard deviation?
Best ans: square root of the variance
['A0: The geometric mean is a measure of the mean return.', "A1: Variance is a measure of how two different random variables move together, but it's often not used in evaluating investments.", "A2: When IBM goes up, does General Motors go up or not? Take deviation of x from its mean times the deviation of it's mean, and take the average product of those.", 'A3: When IBM goes up, does General Motors go up or not?', 'A4: geometric mean', 'A5: The geometric mean', 'A6: square root of the variance', 'A7: the square root of the variance']
Text:But it's often used, and I recommend its use, in evaluating investments. Because if you use gross return, it gives a better measure of the outcome of the investments. If there's ever a year in which the return is minus 100%, then the geometric mean is 0. That's a good discipline. This obviously doesn't make sense as a way to evaluate investment success. But we care about more than just about central tendency when evaluating risk. We have to do other things as well, including the geometric return, variance, variance and variance. And so, you want to talk about risk, this is very fundamental to finance. What could be more fundamental than risk for finance? If x tends to be plus or minus 1% from the mean return, the variance would probably be 1. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Covariance is a measure of how two different random variables move together. When IBM goes up, does General Motors go up or not? We're getting through these concepts, but I'm not going to get into these ideas here, so I'm just trying to be very basic and simple here, but they're very basic. A measure of the co-movement of the two would be to take deviation of x from its mean times the deviation of y from it's mean, and take the average product of those. It's a positive number if, when x is high relative to its mean, y is. And it's a negative number if they tend to go in opposite directions. If GM tends to do well when IBM does poorly, then we have a negative covariance. And this is the core concept that I was talking about. Some idea of unrelatedness underlies a lot of our thinking in risk. If two variables have a plus 1 correlation, that means they move exactly together. If they are independent, then their correlation should be zero. That's true if the random variables are independent of each other. But we're going to see that breakdown of independence is the story of this lecture. We want to think about independence as mattering a lot.

Q1:Who has a limited liability economy?
Q2:Who is not going to apply the geometric mean formula if there are any negative numbers?
Best ans: we
['A0: This is the most basic concept of finance.', 'A1: People who live in a limited liability economy.', 'A2: We have a limited liability economy.', 'A3: The law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put into something.', 'A4: we', 'A5: America', 'A6: American', 'A7: us']

(5) RQUGE:4.6523
Q1:Why was there a pre-break around 2000?
Q2:What is a pre-break?
Best ans: A pre-break is when a market collapses. The stock market collapsed around the world in 2000 and then came back again after 2003.
['A0: There was an pre-break when stocks collapsed around the world.', 'A1: When the stock market collapsed around 2000, the speaker explains that it was a pre-break.', 'A2: A pre-break is when a market collapses.

Q1:When was probability coined?
Q2:When was the word probability coined?
Best ans: According to the passage, probability was not even coined until the 1600's.
["A0: This question is about probability. The final answer: the 1600's.", "A1: According to the passage, probability was not even coined until the 1600's.", "A2: It wasn't even coined until the 1600's.", "A3: Probability in its present meaning wasn't even coined until the 1600's.", 'A4: 1600', 'A5: 1500', 'A6: 1660', "A7: 1600's"]
Text: The word probability in its present meaning wasn't even coined until the 1600's. We do it by dealing with all of these little incremental shocks that affect our lives in a mathematical way. We have mathematical laws of how they accumulate. And once we understand those laws, we can we can build mathematical models of the outcomes. And then we can ask whether we should be surprised by the financial events that we've seen. It's a little bit like science, real hard science. So, for example, weather forecasters build models that are built on the theory of fluid dynamics.  People who are steeped in this tradition in finance think that what we're doing is very much like what we do when we do financial forecasts. We have a statistical model, we see all of the shocks coming in, and of course there will be hurricanes. And we can only forecast them -- you know there's a limit to how far out we can forecast them. Weather forecasters can't do that. Same thing with financial crises. We understand the probability laws, there's only a certain time horizon before which we can.

Q1:How do you calculate the expected value for a random variable?
Q2:What is the average?
Best ans: The expected value of a random variable is the weighted sum of all possible values of x weighte d by their probabilities. The probabilities have to sum to 1. They're positive numbers, or zero. They reflect the likelihood of that random variable occurring, of that value of the random variable. If you have n observations on a randomly chosen random variable, you can take the sum of the x observations, summation over 1 to n, and then divide that by n. This is an estimate of the expected value.

Text:In finance, the basic, the most basic concept that -- in finance -- is that when you invest in something, you have to do it for a time interval. And so, what is your return to investing in something? It's the increase in the price. That's p t plus 1, minus p t. Returns can be positive or negative. They can never be more than -- never be less than minus 100%. In a limited liability economy that we live in, the law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put in. This is the mathematical expectation of a random variable x, which could be the return, or the gross return, but we're going to substitute something else. The expectation of x is the weighted sum of all possible values of x weighted by their probabilities. And the probabilities have to sum to 1. They're positive numbers, or zero, reflecting the likelihood of that random variable occurring, of that value of the random variable. This is for a discrete random variable that takes on only a finite, only a countable number of values. Gross return is always positive. It's between zero and infinity. If you have n observations on a random variable x, you can take the sum of the x observations, summation over i equals 1 to n, and then divide that by n. That's called the average, or the mean, or sample mean, when you have a sample of n observations, which is an estimate of the expected value of x. This is called the mean or average, which you've learned long ago, OK. So, for example, if we're evaluating an investor who has invested money, you could get n observations and take an average of them. The geometric mean makes sense only when all the x's are non-negative. If you put in a negative value, you might get a negative product, and then, if you took the nth root of that, it could be an imaginary number, so let's forget that.

There's many different ways of thinking about a crisis like this. And I wanted to focus on one way that people think about it in terms of probability models. So, that's not the only way, it's not necessarily my favorite way. Excuse my cold. I didn't bring any water. I hope I make it through this lecture.  There was a pre-break around 2000 when the stock market collapsed around the world. But then they came back again after 2003 and they were on another boom, like a roller coaster ride. That's the narrative story. And then, what happened is, we see a bunch of institutional collapses. We saw bank failures in the U.S. and then, we saw international cooperation to prevent this from spreading like a disease. So, we had governments all over the world bailing out their banks and other companies. That's what financial theorists will think about is that actually it's not just those few big events. It's the accumulation of a lot of little events.  I'm going to talk today about probability, variance, and covariance, and regression, and idiosyncratic risk, and systematic risk. But I'm also going to, in the context of the crisis, emphasize in this lecture, breakdowns of some of the most popular assumptions that underlie financial theory. And I'm thinking particularly of two breakdowns. One is the failure of independence. And another one is a tendency for outliers or fat-tailed distributions.

Q1:In finance, what is the most basic concept that returns can be positive or negative?
Q2:What is the most basic concept in finance?
Best ans: The most basic concept in finance is the return to investing in something. The return to investment is the increase in the price.
['A0: The most basic concept in finance is the return to investing in something.', 'A1: The most basic concept in finance is the return to investing in something. The return to investment is the increase in the price.', 'A2: This is the most basic concept that returns can be positive or negative in finance.', "A3: When you invest in something for a time interval, what is your return to investing in something? It's the increase in the price.", 'A4: in finance, the basic', 'A5: they can never be more than -- never be less than -- 100%', 'A6: You have to do it for a time interval', 'A7: you cannot lose more than the money you put in.']
Text:In finance, the basic, the most basic concept that -- in finance -- is that when you invest in something, you have to do it for a time interval. And so, what is your return to investing in something? It's the increase in the price. That's p t plus 1, minus p t. Returns can be positive or negative. They can never be more than -- never be less than minus 100%. In a limited liability economy that we live in, the law says that you cannot lose more than the money you put in. This is the mathematical expectation of a random variable x, which could be the return, or the gross return, but we're going to substitute something else. The expectation of x is the weighted sum of all possible values of x weighted by their probabilities. And the probabilities have to sum to 1. They're positive numbers, or zero, reflecting the likelihood of that random variable occurring, of that value of the random variable. This is for a discrete random variable that takes on only a finite, only a countable number of values. Gross return is always positive. It's between zero and infinity. If you have n observations on a random variable x, you can take the sum of the x observations, summation over i equals 1 to n, and then divide that by n. That's called the average, or the mean, or sample mean, when you have a sample of n observations, which is an estimate of the expected value of x. This is called the mean or average, which you've learned long ago, OK. So, for example, if we're evaluating an investor who has invested money, you could get n observations and take an average of them. The geometric mean makes sense only when all the x's are non-negative. If you put in a negative value, you might get a negative product, and then, if you took the nth root of that, it could be an imaginary number, so let's forget that. We're not going to apply this formula if there are any negative numbers.

Q1:Why can't we predict hurricanes?
Q2:What do financial forecasters do?
Best ans: We can only forecast hurricanes because there is a limit to how far out we can forecast them.
['A0: Hurricanes are unpredictable and unpredictable. We can only predict them based on mathematical laws.', 'A1: A hurricane is a natural phenomenon that cannot be predicted. Weather forecasters can only predict hurricanes within a certain time frame.', 'A2: Weather forecasters build models that are built on the theory of fluid dynamics to predict hurricanes.', 'A3: We can only forecast hurricanes because there is a limit to how far out we can forecast them.', 'A4: financial crises', 'A5: limited time frame before which', 'A6: it has only one time horizon', 'A7: limited time']
Text: The word probability in its present meaning wasn't even coined until the 1600's. We do it by dealing with all of these little incremental shocks that affect our lives in a mathematical way. We have mathematical laws of how they accumulate. And once we understand those laws, we can we can build mathematical models of the outcomes. And then we can ask whether we should be surprised by the financial events that we've seen. It's a little bit like science, real hard science. So, for example, weather forecasters build models that are built on the theory of fluid dynamics.  People who are steeped in this tradition in finance think that what we're doing is very much like what we do when we do financial forecasts. We have a statistical model, we see all of the shocks coming in, and of course there will be hurricanes. And we can only forecast them -- you know there's a limit to how far out we can forecast them. Weather forecasters can't do that. Same thing with financial crises. We understand the probability laws, there's only a certain time horizon before which we can.

Q1:Who were some of these institutions that collapsed?
Q2:What did the financial crisis include?
Best ans: Financial institutions that collapsed include banks and other companies
